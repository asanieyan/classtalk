It is expected that the majority of the information and activities offered in this course will involve equine species (80%) and, to a lesser extent, canine (10%) and bovine species (10%). Teaching and client-owned animals are available for the rotation. Although emphasis is given on hands-on activities, didactic instruction of selected topics in clinical Theriogenology will be discussed.

    :description: Senior DVM students will have the opportunity to undertake an elective rotation in an approved practice externship in a large animal practice a) food animal/rural or b) equine/mixed animal. The practice opportunity will meet the need recognized by students, CVM faculty and private practice colleagues alike to increase "hands on" experience in a private practice setting. Private practice experiences are available for year 1 - 3 students through the selective offerings. Presently, senior studentshave the opportunity to experience private practice by arranging an externship as an elective. However, initiating an elective course will ensure consistency between experiences, with clear expectations to achieve an approved level of learning/skills objectives with verification from the practice. Practitioners will be valuable partners in the education process in the senior year, providing access to individual animal and herd-related clinical diversity that is increasingly difficult to offer in the academic setting.
