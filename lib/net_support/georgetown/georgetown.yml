    :description: "The effective analysis of a set of financial statements and related reports requires an understanding of (1) economic characteristics and current conditions of a firm's business, (2) the particular strategies the firm selects to compete in each of these businesses, and (3) the accounting principles and procedures underlying the firm's financial statements. This three-fold approach is used in this course to elevate the process of financial statement analysis from one involving the mechanical calculation of a long list of financial statement ratios to one where the student (analyst/consultant) has an opportunity to integrate concepts from economics, strategy, accounting, and other business disciplines. In addition to introducing analytical tools for assessing profitability and risk, this course also examines the concepts of quality of earnings and it counterpart, the quality of financial position. The premise of this course is that the student will learn financial statement analysis most effectively by performing analysis on actual companies. Prerequisite: ACCT 550."

  - :name: Civic Engagement & Education
    :number: "157"
    :description: "Throughout history, philosophers, political theorists, and citizen activists have argued that the existence of a vibrant and just democracy demands much more of citizens than a vote cast in a ballot box periodically; citizens must become actively engaged in addressing the social and political problems facing their communities and the larger society. In turn, as many have also argued, effective engagement demands that all youth be educated in particular ways so that they are able to participate in this activity. This course focuses on the intersection of youth civic engagement and education. Topics addressed include conceptions of civic engagement, specific examples of effective and ineffective engagement drawn from American history, strategies and models of effective engagement, the theoretical and actual role of schooling in preparing youth for civic engagement, youth attitudes toward civic engagement, and specific recommendations and strategies that can be used in educational settings to promote youth engagement. A special emphasis will be placed on the disempowerment experienced by low-income students of color in low-performing schools, and the role that schooling can play in either further marginalizing these students or empowering them. Georgetown students in this course will be expected to take a very active role in the classroom and to assume responsibility for their own, their peers\xE2\x80\x99, and the professor\xE2\x80\x99s learning in the course. Students must enroll for 4 credits. In addition to the standard twice-weekly class meetings, readings, and assignments, students will be required to complete assignments and activities related to a community-based civic engagement project. Each student will coach a small group of high-school age students on a project addressing a community problem selected by the group. Georgetown students will meet with their students on a twice-weekly basis during the school day to identify an issue for the project; research previous initiatives to address the problem and evaluate their effectiveness; and develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of an original effort to address the problem. In addition, Georgetown students will be required to participate in a twice a month reflective seminar with their Georgetown peers at which they will be learn strategies for working with at-risk high school age students and discuss their experiences working with these students. Georgetown students will help plan a culminating conference at which they and their groups will present their work to the campus and local community. Those who enroll in this course do not need to have any prior teaching experience. Due to the uncertainty of the public school course schedule planning process, we don\xE2\x80\x99t know yet the days and times for the school site visits; there may be some flexibility in the schedule of these visits to accommodate Georgetown student schedules. The twice-monthly seminars are tentatively scheduled for Fridays from 4-5:30."

    :description: The notion of fame has deep historical roots, but "celebrity" is a relatively recent phenomenon that has emerged through the technological innovations of the last 150 years. This course will examine celebrity as media spectacle, celebrity as a process in which every production waits to be eclipsed by the next production. Drawing from several disciplines, we will attempt to understand American celebrity as a product of the cult of the individual and as an integral feature of advanced capitalism. Case studies will range from the marketing of child star Shirley Temple to the trial of O.J. Simpson.

SF ignites the Industrial Revolution; carries out the Cold War; invents the Internet. In this course, we'll look at SF and the scientist as culture-hero in turn-of-the-century America; the birth of \"fan culture\" in the 1930's; we'll examine how SF informs the American myth of progress and how it permeates the rhetoric of politics and diplomacy following the Second World War. We'll look at the body and SF, from the Ubermensch to the post-human cyborgs we've already become. We'll draw from periodicals like Amazing Stories and Popular Mechanics; non-fiction like Boyer's By the Bomb's Early Light (1985) and Davis' City of Quartz (1992); radio drama like War of the Worlds (1938); novels like Delilo's White Noise (1985) and Stephenson's Snow Crash (1992); a variety of short stories from SF's \"Golden Age\"; television like Star Trek (1966\xE2\x80\x931969) and The Day After (1983); cinema like Forbidden Planet (1956), Alien (1979), Koyaanisqatsi (1983), Blade Runner (1982/92), and Fog of War (2003); theater like that of Survival Research Labs (1978\xE2\x80\x932006); and computer games like Space Invaders and Suspended (1983). We'll make use of theoretical perspectives of Susan Sontag, Vivian Sobchack, Scott Bukatman, Langdon Winner, Darko Suvin, David E. Nye, and others. Using a private web-based wiki, students will regularly contribute brief reflections on SF concepts or themes of their choosing. Students will have the opportunity to write a final research paper or produce a short digital documentary that makes use of SF's richly aural and visual tradition. The class meets Monday and Wednesday, 2:40\xE2\x80\x933:55PM. Films will be screened at an optional session in New South on Monday nights from 7\xE2\x80\x9310PM; students may also watch assigned films on their own. Garrison LeMasters Georgetown University"

    :description: "There are no sites of identity more intense, more personal, and more contentious than the intersection of gender, sexuality and the body. Using these themes as a locus, this seminar will range across a rich field: from psychoanalysis to queer studies to performance studies and beyond. Concurrent with our thematic focus on gender/sexuality/body, we will also address questions of method: what does it mean to do a cultural studies of gender/sex/body? To meet these two aims, readings will consist of both theoretical explorations as well as case studies which use theoretical constructs to perform cultural analysis. Students may expect to encounter the works of Sigmund Freud, Michel Foucault, Judith Butler, Julia Kristeva, Joan Scott, Helen Cixous, Lauren Berlant, Luce Irigaray, bell hooks, Gayatri Spivak, Eve Sedgwick, and Donna Haraway, among others. Substantial reading, writing, and discussion will be required. In order to facilitate a research project, a project proposal (including statement of method), literature review, and preliminary evidence analysis will be the primary student product."

    :number: "226"
    :description: "Reading works that represent a variety of ethnic groups, genres, and historical backgrounds, this course will introduce students to the primary issues and events that have shaped Asian American literature and culture in the last century. Moving from the contexts of myth-making and law to politics, economics, and education, we will consider how Asian American writers have intervened in American institutions and policies. How have they responded to U.S. ideologies that have historically identified Asian Americans as perpetual \xE2\x80\x9Caliens\xE2\x80\x9D? Paying particular attention to the development of Asian American narratives, languages, politics, and identity, we will be investigating the ways in which these works represent a unified Asian American perspective, even as we differentiate on the basis of ethnicity, gender, class background, and sexual orientation. Finally, we will contextualize our readings with the current debates over the state of race, multiculturalism, and Asian America at the start of the twenty-first century. In every way, this class is organized around the concept of class engagement. It is important that students think consistently about the issues and works we are discussing, come to each class prepared to offer analysis of the reading for that day, and make every effort to understand how the course is asking them to read, think, and write differently. Attendance and a respect for and engagement with the authors\xE2\x80\x99 texts and others\xE2\x80\x99 comments are mandatory."

    :description: This advanced course examines the role of performance in the shifting notions of American ethnic, racial, and national identity from the founding of the Republic and the American Revolution to the present day. Together we will explore the myriad roles of performance in vying for, maintaining, and contesting political power, fundamental both to the exercise of political authority and to the formation of new structures of nationalist feeling. Our method of inquiry in the class will be drawn from the field of performance studies, which combines aesthetic and social theory in the study of expressive social behaviors. We will examine a variety of performance practices to develop a social historiography of embodied culture. The United States serves as the scenario for this course, though the issues will be more generally relevant and students are encouraged to explore other national contexts.

  - :name: Women's Health in the 21st Century
    :number: "235"
    :description: "This course proposes an interdisciplinary exploration of what it means--historically, culturally, physically, and medically--to have a women's body. As such, it provides an introduction to the key issues affecting women's health in the United States. The course is organized as an integrated sequence of study that includes: multimedia examination of historical constructs of female physical beauty and health; analysis of theory on women's body image and the social, economic, and political influences on women's health; scientific/medical study of women's bodies (physiologically women are NOT small men); and current challenges facing women's health. This course will strive to keep students working between theory and practice, so that positive body image and good health do not remain separate from intellectual understanding. For example, so many women's studies students intellectually understand the \"problem\" of body image and the associated impact on lifestyle decisions, yet many still starve themselves or adopt dangerous habits (i.e., smoking). These behaviors often result in a complex of symptoms known as the female triad: disordered eating patterns, amenorrhea (lack of menstruation), and osteoporosis. Additionally, potential cardiovascular, endocrine, and gastrointestinal consequences can occur. Thus, this course will explore the ways that women have defined their bodies, how the representation of women's bodies permeates the culture, and the resultant affects on women's sense of self-esteem and associated patterns of risk-taking behavior. In addition to developing a sense of \"ownership\" regarding how we view and treat our bodies, we will explore ways that social, political, public policy, and economic issues impact women's medical care and health. Recent evidence has shown that many health conditions have been under-diagnosed in women and that this gender bias has affected the management and outcomes of these diseases. Additionally, the report of the Public Health Service Task Force on Women's Health indicated that women have been seriously under-represented in clinical research, which has led to a lack of clinical data regarding the treatment of diseases that affect women solely, predominantly, or differently. Although the course will concentrate on health in this country, we also will do some comparative readings and spend one class session about women and health in other countries--to highlight the universal issues impacting women's health."

  - :name: Women and the Law
    :number: "251"
    :description: In 1993, Toni Morrison became the eighth woman, first African American, first African American woman, and first Black woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. In its citation, the Swedish Academy praised her as one "who, in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality." This course--The Fiction of Toni Morrison--seeks to examine that "essential aspect of American reality" in Morrison's seven novels. Her works have received great acclaim, both critical and popular, because they celebrate the intricacies and complexities of human existence, in general, and Black life, specifically. Writing novels that she describes as novels she wanted to read, Morrison has chronicled African American experience from its beginnings in slavery to post-integration. Thus she has added not only to the African American literary and cultural landscape but also to the American literary and cultural landscape.

Students will engage with a variety of texts--drawn primarily from history, American Studies, and cultural studies--as a way of considering various models for understanding the complimentary relationship between "gender identities" and "popular culture." We will consider race, ethnicity, class, and sexual identities across a range of forms, including fashion, television, advertising, bars, dance halls, and discos. Students will also actively engage in their own critical projects concerning gender issues in popular cultural forms and show their critical analysis through the creation of multimedia narrative projects ('digital stories').

This comparative survey follows the misadventures of the Trickster through twentieth-century America. Drawing on theories of transgression and the ludic, students will consider the various social and aesthetic functions attributed to this bawdy anti-hero and his comic-erotic tales. The class will make use of a variety of discursive modes and media: Oral performance, ethnography, blues and rock music, the novel, critical theory, the animated film short, fake news, and the digital mashup. Students will look for parallels and contrarities among twentieth\xE2\x80\x93century American tricksters drawn from Native American, Asian, African, European, and Latina/o traditions.

This course will be less a biographical study of this musical enigma than an attempt to place him within the broader context of American musical life. We will use Gershwin as a starting place to explore aspects of African-American music, Tin Pan Alley song, Broadway musicals, concert hall performance, opera, Hollywood film, the piano, media and technology, and the issue of \"Musical Jewishness.\" By focusing on Gershwin, we will see how a single American composer can bridge many of the dichotomies found in American music: black/white, highbrow/lowbrow, and art/pop.

    :description: "When comedian Stephen Colbert coined the term \xE2\x80\x9Ctruthiness,\xE2\x80\x9D he touched more than the nation\xE2\x80\x99s funny bone. Embedded within this comic gag is a deep concern over how American citizens use (or misuse) information. \xE2\x80\x9CTruthiness\xE2\x80\x9D pokes fun not only at politicians and public officials who bend facts for self-serving purposes, but also at journalists and commentators who are complicit in abuses of information, citizens who have a responsibility to be skeptical about poor quality information, and even academics who deconstruct information to the nth degree and often obliterate its integrity. \xE2\x80\x9CTruth\xE2\x80\x9D is a human construct that carries human responsibilities. We see snapshots of this in a movie like A Few Good Men, in the oft-parodied exchange when Tom Cruise shouts \xE2\x80\x9CI want the Truth,\xE2\x80\x9D and Jack Nicholson retorts, \xE2\x80\x9CYou can\xE2\x80\x99t handle the truth.\xE2\x80\x9D We can also see ranges of truth by comparing a film like Al Gore\xE2\x80\x99s An Inconvenient Truth, in which the preponderance of evidence about global warming is inescapable, to the recent political allegory Cach\xC3\xA9 (French for \xE2\x80\x9CHidden), in which two adult men clash fatally over a childhood memory and we discover \xE2\x80\x9Ctruth\xE2\x80\x9D is irrelevant compared to the feelings attached to the interpretations. This seminar springs from a simple question: What are the responsibilities of individual citizens acting as gate-keepers in an information-rich civil society? Some examples: Prior to the Vietnam War journalists foretold many of the problems that would and did arise. Why did the United States plunge ahead? The \xE2\x80\x9Cwar on terror\xE2\x80\x9D is rife with confusion and misinformation. Why did America again commit troops overseas? In personal relationships, lovers often ignore obvious clues and their status. Why do we think we see what is not there? Retail spenders often make purchases based on incomplete information. Television commentators scream opinions with little evidence to back up their claims. The government is cutting taxes and increasing deficits while corporations are shedding pension programs and baby boomers are about to retire. What is wrong with this picture? Through readings and viewings, seminar discussions, and a semester paper this class will analyze and theorize about \xE2\x80\x9Cquality of information\xE2\x80\x9D to explore the mutual gate-keeping responsibilities of media producers and citizens who consume information."

These performers may be regarded as \xE2\x80\x9Ccritics\xE2\x80\x9D because they all, in disparate ways, passed judgments on American culture; furthermore, they did not, as twenty-first century scholars do, worry about genre distinctions. Instead, they moved from one creative realm to another with ease. We will study the varied and complicated strategies that these critics used to gain access to the public sphere and to redefine the seemingly private sphere. For example, to protect their status as respectable wives and mothers, many women voiced their concerns indirectly, composing ballads and poems rife with hidden meanings, instead of publishing non-fiction commentaries. Others published their work anonymously, or under a male or female pseudonym. Still others populated the stage with dramatic characters who were bolder than they themselves could be. We will analyze the implications of the women\xE2\x80\x99s various avenues toward publication as well as their actual songs, poems, lectures, plays, and autobiographical novels. Our readings will include works by black and white women critics: Lucy Terry Prince, Phillis Wheatley Peters, Susanna Haswell Rowson, Judith Sargent Murray, Maria W.

Students will have an opportunity to study the varied and complicated strategies that female anti-slavery writers and speakers used to gain access to the public sphere or to redefine the \xE2\x80\x9Cprivate\xE2\x80\x9D sphere so that they could perform their sense of an emancipated America. Many activists found it difficult to publish their critiques as non-fiction, so they fictionalized their stories, composing ballads and poems instead of essays. Other abolitionists published their work anonymously, or under a male or female pseudonym. We will analyze the implications of the women\xE2\x80\x99s various avenues toward publication as well as their actual anti-slavery poems, essays, plays, speeches, short stories, letters, and autobiographical novels. Our theoretical readings and archival adventures will help us illuminate how female anti-slavery advocates shaped and reshaped the intersecting performances of womanhood, \xE2\x80\x9Crace,\xE2\x80\x9D sexuality and American-ness. Our readings will include Phillis Wheatley, Judith Sargeant Murray, Susanna Haswell Rowson, Maria W. Stewart, Lydia Maria Child, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and a host of lesser-known anti-slavery lecturers and essayists. We will analyze these women\xE2\x80\x99s publications within the context of contemporaneous debates about (in)visibility, identity, \xE2\x80\x9Crace,\xE2\x80\x9D and nation in an effort to understand the tangled performance of anti-slavery in the United States.

How is social violence hidden, and justified, in religious ritual and language? Subjects for the course will include various essays, novels, sermons, as well as media and texts from contemporary American culture. We will begin with the theocratic civility of the Puritan nation, and focus, in particular, on the nightmare theologies of Jonathan Edwards. We will then look at the inversion of this language in fantasists like Edgar Allan Poe, HP Lovecraft, and Stephen King. We will consider the social uses of this debased-religious discourse in the creation of nationalist racial fantasies, and we shall examine the social violence of terror in the ceremony of lynching. We will consider, if not di rectly examine, the political uses of this language in speeches and in nationalist hymns and poetry from Abraham Lincoln through Ronald Reagan, George Bush, and beyond.

In terms of content, we explore these authors' depiction of the Jewish-American community, its internal tensions (especially as regards gender), its interaction with the gentile world, and its relation with the state of Israel. As for form, the class scrutinizes the literary style of the writers in question in hopes of determining if something such as "Jewish-American literary idiom" really exists.

What is this thing, \"love\", that all of these have in common? What unique features do the various forms of love have? The first half of the course will address questions about the nature of love in general and about the specific forms of love, especially friendship, largely through classic readings from authors like Plato, Aquinas and Kierkegaard, though with some contemporary readings as well. Once we have more of an understanding of love in general, the second half of the course will focus more specifically on sexual love. We will discuss both general issues such as marriage and the nature and value of sexuality, as well as more specific issues in sexual ethics of contemporary controversy such as pornography, homosexuality, contraception, etc. In regard to the more specific issues, we will have an eclectic mix of readings, largely contemporary, ranging from feminist theorists to Catholic writers.

    :description: As students living in Washington D.C., you may be familiar with the city's range of non-profits and intergovernmental agencies focused on development. This course is an invitation to step back and think critically about what development means, and how gendered assumptions underpin development theory and practices. How do development policies sometimes preserve, and at other times, transform gender relations? How have women been studied and incorporated/co-opted into the field of development? We will engage with the political economic context of neoliberal globalization, theories of development, and transnational and postcolonial feminist critiques. This involves critically examining the founding binaries of the field, such as 'first world/third world', 'traditional/modern', 'productive/reproductive labor' and 'global/local.' Our readings include case studies of how women cope with, and resist, economic and social injustice. Topics addressed are (a) poverty alleviation strategies, micro credit and fair trade movements (b) population policies and reproductive rights (c) global assembly line work (d) tourism and the sex trade (e) AIDS and (f) the environment and sustainable development. By the end of the semester, we will have interrogated and compared gender relations in varied regions of the world, while pondering the question of how power works, in and through the field of development.

    :number: 038
    :description: This course covers one of the most vital periods of music and dance in America. Ballet, modern dance, theatrical dance, dance in the movies, and social dance were all undergoing great changes as well as burgeoning popularity; and there was significant overlap between types that are today considered quite distinct. Ballet pioneer George Balanchine and modern dance choreographer Agnes de Mille not only innovated within "serious" theatrical dance but also made dances for Broadway and the movies; Fred Astaire brought social dance to a highly polished theatrical level with both his sister Adele and Ginger Rogers; football and hockey player Gene Kelly turned down a position with the Ballets Russes and went on to revolutionize dance on film; tap dance was, like rock and roll, an product of American racial interaction. This was also a period in which social dancing was a major shaping force of popular culture, from the swing of the 1930s through the jive of the 1940s and a string of Latin dance crazes, culminating in perhaps the greatest dance revolution of the century, the Twist. Other key figures include Martha Graham, Bill Robinson, Shirley Temple, Sonja Henie, the Nicholas Brothers, Eleanor Powell, and composers Aaron Copland, Richard Rodgers, and Elliott Carter. Spring.

In this course, students will use popular culture as a site from which to analyze the story American culture told/tells through popular culture forms.

We will undertake these analyses collectively, ranging widely across a great diversity of American popular culture artifacts since World War II (such as, film, cartoons, dancing, television and music). Questions this course will address include: What meaning does popular culture communicate? What theoretical perspectives can aid in understanding that meaning? How has American popular culture changed over the last half-century? How has the development of new technologies opened new avenues of popular culture and foreclosed old ones?

Reading both canonical and popular literature, we will analyze the escalating importance of sexuality in the American cultural and political imagination. We will evaluate overlapping discourses of eroticism, morality, and public health as they shape representations of sex and sexuality, and will also devote particular attention to the part played by the sexual body in evolving constructions of race and gender, in emergent class identities, and in nineteenth-century political conflicts. Part of our purpose will be to examine the way that representations of sexuality in these texts prefigure the division of sexuality into an opposition between 'homosexuality' and 'heterosexuality'; however, we will also address the forms taken by sexuality beyond this binary division.

In this course we will discuss what is conventionally and conveniently called \xE2\x80\x9Cscience fiction,\xE2\x80\x9C and we will explore the relative limitations of this nomenclature as black writers, artists, and intellectuals conceptualize a radical politics of representation through an approach to cultural production that traditionally has been considered \xE2\x80\x9Cwhite.\xE2\x80\x9D Considering that identity and agency are inevitably mediated through a shifting conjunction of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nationality, it is important that we take an accurate measure of the extent to which what we understand to be reality is informed by ruptures in and modifications of this media. Over this term we will discuss a range of speculative text, including but certainly not limited to novels by George Schuyler, Octavia Butler, Samuel Delany, and Nalo Hopkinson; films by Melvin Van Peebles and Haile Gerima; and music by Sun Ra, Prince, and MF Doom. We will think through the ways in which blackness in particular is constructed and reconfigured as these cultural workers theorize new modes of critical resistance.

In the twentieth century, a number of American writers, both Black and White, have written novels that engage the institution of slavery. What types of cultural work do these revisions of slavery perform? How do memory and history function in the American literary imagination? Our readings and discussions will focus on two emancipatory (commonly known as slave)narratives and several novels about slavery by African American writers. Additionally, we will read a number of novels by Anglo-American writers. Writers may include Frederick Douglass, Toni Morrison, Willa Cather and Valerie Martin. We will consider the following questions: what are some of the reasons for revisiting slavery in literature; how does the imagination augment our understanding of the past; why does slavery continue to haunt contemporary society; and what function does the contemporary narrative serve for its readers?

Politics, music, literature, philosophy, theater, art, poetry and the aesthetics will be our guide. The study of African American culture and its interaction with American and world society as a whole will be the mission of this class. We will look at the syncopated rhythms of the African people transferred to American shores by enslaved Africans, starting with the \xE2\x80\x9CNegro Spirituals. Political debates between W.E.B.

Washington, between DuBois and Marcus Garvey and between Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Brother Malcolm X will also be demonstrated how history and politics affected the culture of Black people. We will look at white America\xE2\x80\x99s perception of African Americans and analyze how these ideas were formed and why they continue to exist and why they persist. We will look at the major intellectual, cultural, and performance arts during the Harlem Renaissance (performers such as Paul Robeson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Marian Anderson, and Bessie Smith). We will watch films and film clips of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Miles Davis and Thelonius Monk.

To others, the Civil War set whole new revolutions in motion, some of which remain incomplete. In either interpretation, the war overturned institutions, political habits, and the role of government for everyone in the nation. For those who lived in the southern half of the nation, the war abruptly eliminated the basic social structure that defined and ordered every aspect of life, and turned the single greatest source of wealth in the entire nation, slaves, into free men and women. The aftermath of the war presented the problem and the opportunity of doing nothing less than remaking society, and at war\xE2\x80\x99s close some Americans hoped that the Federal government would dedicate itself to doing just that.

    :description: "This course offers an introduction to the environmental history of the Americas from the depths of pre-history to our own times. It begins with a synoptic look at the long stretch of time running from the age of dinosaurs to our own geological epoch, and then concentrates on three eras of dramatic environmental change: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when Native Americans first encountered Europeans and Africans along the shores of the western Atlantic; the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when colonialism, the rise of global markets, industrialization and increasing urbanization recast the ecology and culture of much of the western hemisphere; and the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, when new energy regimes, massive population growth and an emerging ecological awareness, among other factors, thrust the natural world into political and social consciousness. In each of these eras, we will focus on the ways in which shifting human activities, cultural patterns, and ecological dynamics contributed to the overall patterns of environmental change. One goal of the course will be to provide an historical context for understanding many of our current environmental problems and issues. Since the literature is much more developed for North America than for Central and South America, North America will receive more attention in this course. We will, though, strive to place developments within a hemisphere-wide context. Topics will include Native Americans, colonialism, disease and demography, agriculture, urbanization, energy, biodiversity, natural resource use, waste, changing views of the natural world, and the conservation and environmental movements.

Within a single generation, the market revolution transformed the American economy, a democratic revolution transformed its political structure into a two-party system that continues to dominate today, and the Second Great Awakening swept across the social and cultural landscape. The age called Americans\xE2\x80\x99 most basic notions into question, redefining everything from how a government should work to what it meant to be a man or a woman. It also created notions we take for granted today, such as the idea of a middle class.

It witnessed the systematic removal of whole peoples from their homes, and it set the wheels of continental expansion in motion. And all the while, many Americans genuinely saw their nation as a land of unbounded promise and opportunity for common people.

We begin with an exploration of the history and distinctiveness of American English, including the language histories of the principal ethnic and racialized groups in the U.S., specifically African American English and Chicano English. We proceed by exploring other languages spoken in this country including Spanish, American Sign Language, Korean, Japanese, Creoles, and Native American languages relating these to issues of bilingualism, acquisition, and the English Only Movement. Finally, in understanding how particular languages, dialects, and ways of speaking are involved in the construction of privileged or stigmatized identities, we focus on intra-group differences and inter-group comparisons, challenging the assumption that "the language problem" is at the root of many of our nation's ethnic tensions. Important themes will include the implications of linguistic discrimination for the survival of minority languages and cultures, the educational success of children, equity in the workplace, and inter-racial/ethnic conflict.

    :number: "161"
    :description: "America is sometimes described as a land without philosophy, as when Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, \"I think that in no country in the civilized world is less attention paid to philosophy than in the United States. The Americans have no philosophical school of their own, and they care but little for all the schools into which Europe is divided, the very names of which are scarcely known to them.\" We have produced no Plato, Descartes, or Kant. America is the birthplace, however, of pragmatism. Indeed, pragmatism has often been thought to capture distinctively American attitudes: a preference for practical success over principled stances; a materialist approach to life; an instinct for the bottom line. Thus, it comes as no surprise to read William James declare that in order to choose between competing philosophies, we must spell them out in terms of their \"cash-value.\" Pragmatism is something of an anti-philosophy, at least if Plato, Descartes, and Kant are our models of philosophers. Consonant with these \"pragmatist\" stances, American legal realists declare that legal \"rules are important so far as they help you to predict what judges will do. That is all their importance except as pretty playthings\" (Karl Llewellyn) and \"a legal duty so called is nothing but a prediction that if a man does or omits certain things he will be made to suffer in this or that way by judgment of the court; \xE2\x80\x94and so of a legal right\" (Justice Holmes). In the context of political philosophy, John Dewey argues that an uncompromising commitment to the Bill of Rights represents an \"idolatry of the Constitution,\" rather than a pragmatic concern for balancing powers and prerogatives so as to produce the best overall result. In this course we will examine American Legal Realism and Dewey's vision of participatory democracy in depth. We will locate and develop the philosophical underpinnings of these expressions of pragmatism, and we will challenge them both with respect to their philosophical foundations and their practical effects."

In doing so, it considers a series of gender-related issues in three parts: 1) the historical use of the law to create and maintain key institutions of gender-based oppression in society; 2) the efforts of activists, lawyers, and legal scholars to use the law to gain equal access to/equal treatment by such institutions, to dismantle those institutions, and/or to create new institutions; and 3) the effectiveness of legal tools in counteracting and changing the original character of legal institutions designed to implement and perpetuate gender-based oppression. Using U.S., non-U.S., and international legal sources, the course examines such topics as marriage, gendered violence, employment, prostitution and trafficking, and reproductive rights and asks the ultimate question - whether the \xE2\x80\x9CMaster\xE2\x80\x99s Tools\xE2\x80\x9D (the law) can dismantle the \xE2\x80\x9CMaster\xE2\x80\x99s House\xE2\x80\x9D (a society built on gender-based oppression).

    :number: "001"
    :description: "This course is designed as an overview of and introduction to the field of cultural anthropology. In the first half of the course, using a standard cultural anthropology textbook and supplemental reader we will explore the religious systems, subsistence strategies, political institutions, kinship and gender relations, and other aspects of sociocultural organization of societies across the globe. In the second part of the semester, utilizing a series of \xE2\x80\x9Cmini-ethnographies\xE2\x80\x9D we will focus in on a dozen or so small-scale, preindustrial societies within the context of their traditional lifestyles and belief systems, as well as examining the various ways in which these societies have changed and adapted to external pressures brought about by things like European colonial contacts and their relatively recent inclusion in global capitalist economy."

    :description: In this crosscultural course we examine gender as a central category of analysis. In short, we will study how gender matters. We also consider how gender interrelates with race, class, and nationality. We begin by exploring the historical development of anthropological perspectives on gender. We will question how these perspectives have challenged and transformed both anthropology and feminism. We then will read some of the most exciting new ethnographies in which gender is central. This means we will read not only about women and constructions of femininity in various cultures, but also about men and constructions of masculinity.

    :description: "With the demise of the old Western imperialisms especially after World War II, and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the late twentieth century, nations everywhere have tended to re-organise themselves into new regionalist political/economic groupings (e.g. EU, NAFTA), and to assert corresponding ethnic/cultural identities (e.g. \xE2\x80\x98European\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98North American\xE2\x80\x99) intended to override existing differences. Inspired by Benedict Anderson\xE2\x80\x99s (1983) equation of nineteenth century nationalist ideologies with \xE2\x80\x98imagined communities\xE2\x80\x99, and Arjun Appadurai\xE2\x80\x99s (1990) account of \xE2\x80\x98imagined worlds\xE2\x80\x99 in the present-day global cultural economy, this course will examine how over recent decades New Zealand has redefined itself as \xE2\x80\x98a Pacific nation\xE2\x80\x99, and why in turn Pacific Islands nations generally have cautiously accepted New Zealand\xE2\x80\x99s regionalist identity assertions and associated leadership assumptions.

  - :name: Multiculturalism & Urban Life in Australia
    :number: "220"
    :description: Australia is a laboratory for understanding many issues in modern urban life including the dilemmas of the so-called "multicultural society." How may people and groups who share few cultural traditions live together for the well-being of all? How may a nation emerge from diverse language, religious, and cultural traditions? Since the days of the penal colonies, Australian urban institutions (most notably, state and national governments) have actively struggled with these questions, particularly as they affect Australia's equalitarian ethos. Opening with a new study of women prisoners on transport ships and the penal colony of New South Wales, the course traces the impact of the multicultural debate on the lives of Aborigines, "new" and "old" Australians. By studying Anzac Day, the Australian holiday commemorating the battle of Gallipoli, students will critically evaluate the impact of war on forging national identity in multicultural countries. Students will complete the course by examining the usefulness of new theories about the role of culture in modern nation states for understanding Australian urban life. (Not offered 2005-06)

    :description: Australia has gradually recognized itself as a multicultural nation over the last fifty years. This course will explore dimensions of cultural practice derived from Aboriginal and European cultures as well as their interaction in contemporary Australia. Family life has long constituted a core institution for Australians of European descent. We will examine cultural images and practice of family relations with its associated gender roles through film, autobiography and ethnography. The religious practice of Australian Aborigines historically structured many aspects of indigenous life, including relations to land, other people and individual biography. We will examine these connections through the careful study of Aboriginal painting, body art and material decoration. Over the last fifty years, Australians of European and Aboriginal descent have disputed and negotiated with each other about the significance of race, family, religion and land in the colonial context. We will study the legacy of these conflicts in the everyday lives of contemporary Aborigines. The course will close by examining how these disputes acquired an international character in recent years as indigenous peoples from colonized nations across the globe have become aware of their common experiences and mobilized to improve their lives.

    :number: "290"
    :description: Anthropologists have long studied the Middle East much as they studied other cultures--through "participant observation" that often cloaked unexamined assumptions of the primitiveness of their subjects. Such assumptions have, however, fallen by the wayside throughout the discipline. History, literature, and mass media are now just as much "ethnographic material" as the anthropologist's traditional ahistorically conceived relationship with "informants." Consequently this course will examine Arab societies through a broad range of material, including films and literature. Topics covered in the course will include family structure, gender, language and identity, nationalism, Arab-American migrant communities, modernity, Islam, and fundamentalism in comparative perspective.

    :description: This course turns the ethnographic gaze on the societies in the Euro-American core which gave rise to anthropology as an academic discipline. In the seminar we will use paired sets of ethnographic case studies from the same national context in order to investigate changing notions of fieldwork sites, subject communities, research questions, and the notion of culture itself. These case studies will be compared and contrasted in light of the different theoretical models and larger historical circumstances informing them. For example, Scheper-Hughes's Saints, Scholars, and Schizophrenics (1979), a path breaking study of mental illness in rural Ireland using Durkheimiam theory and psychological models, will be followed by Aretxaga's Shattering Silence (1997). This is an ethnography of the violence and political conflict in the urban West Belfast neighborhoods of Northern Ireland, informed by interpretive anthropology and poststructuralist feminist theory.

    :description: "This anthropology course is designed to introduce students to the processes and forms of cultural retention, acculturation, syncretism, reinterpretation, transformation, and innovation that are evident in African derived cultural diaspoas of the Americas. While the ownership of black cultural forms in the \xE2\x80\x98New World\xE2\x80\x99 has has been a perennial and complex issue during the 20th century, things become clearer as we unravel the strands of culture, power, and history. Using anthropological concepts, we explore the processes that brought African social and cultural institutions as well as Islam to the Diasporas of the Caribbean, Latin America, and the United States. We build upon Wallerstein and Rodney\xE2\x80\x99s notions of a world economic system to show how the use of slave labor fueled the development of the Americas, and look at the cultural byproduct of that labor. Examining African social and cultural adaptations to the plantation economies, to gender and spiritual challenges, and to urban life helps us trace the cultural forms and commodities produced, and the commonalities and variations that emerged within black populations of these areas. We examine the cultural forms of resistance to domination and the creation of different creole cultures in the Americas, as Africans dealt with Indigenous peoples, Anglos, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Some of the cultural areas we examine include Brazil, Haiti, Jamaica, Ecuador/Colombia, Cuba, New Orleans, South Carolina, and other historical and recent black cultures of the United States."

Drug foods with complex histories and changing properties must be viewed from historical, political, economic, geographical, and gendered perspectives. They are linked to such globally salient issues as sustainable development, land tenure, international trade, state politics, and global identities. The course begins with a comprehensive overview of theories of commodities, consumption, and gifts. From there, we move to study the cultivation, processing, sale, advertising, and consumption of these foods. We will trace changing patterns of food consumption and shifting meanings attached to their use and exchange as well as the implications for households, communities, businesses, cultures, and nations under changing international circumstances. The texts chosen\xE2\x80\x93single-authored monographs, book chapters, articles, films, and television episodes\xE2\x80\x93are drawn primarily from anthropology but also include selections from other disciplines.

    :description: "This seminar will look at issues of international migration from European perspectives and will introduce students to important contemporary debates on migration through sociological and anthropological research. By tracing the history of migration in Europe, it will examine the process of acculturation in various contexts where legal frameworks, colonial histories, and current policies differ. Increasingly, researchers have taken into consideration the fact that while migrants leave their countries, they never leave their identities and cultures behind. New approaches to the study of migrations follow the entire trajectories of migrants, not only in terms of their national origins, but also in terms of their social classes, urban or rural origins, generational status, etc. In order to explore these issues, we will compare several migrational situations in Europe sharing the similarity that most of the migrants involved are Muslims: North African migration in France, Spain, and Belgium; Turkish migration in France and Germany, and Pakistani migration in Great Britain. Using the theoretical work of social and cultural theorists such as Bourdieu, Sayad, Arkoum, and Giddens, we will explore how Islamic migrations have effectuated change in European cultures in areas such as identity formation, civic status and participation, social mobility, and debates on fundamentalism and secularism.

Comparative discussions enable analysis of data from South and Central Asia, the Middle East and North America. Cases are selected in part for their fame in the political anthropology literature. While various approaches are presented, stress is on viewing ethnicity and nationalism as socio-politically constructed, situational and in flux. Debates concerning liberal nationalism, empires, colonialism, multiethnic state formation, nation state models, borders, federalism, civic society, multiculturalism, interethnic conflict, racialisation and racism are covered. The class meets on Tuesdays 2:15-4:05. It includes lecturing, discussion and role playing, with some guest speakers.

  - :name: Religion and Globalization in South Asia
    :number: "490"
    :description: We can now live in Sao Paolo and communicate instantly with people in Chicago. We can sit in a room in countries as far flung as Indonesia and Germany and watch MTV. Software engineers in Bangalore , India do business in Silicon Valley, California. With increasing technology binding us ever closer, and economic networks making it increasingly necessary for us to communicate with each other as a world community we need to examine the nature of the phenomena of globalization and the role of religion and ideology in the world today. Is globalization just a cliche for our times, an expression of the current 'Zeitgeist', or could it be used as an analytical tool to better understand the profound and rapid changes in the world order that we are currently witnessing? What kind of changes does the globalization process imply for the development of democracy, for sovereignty, and economic progress? And how can we influence this process towards inclusion instead of marginalization, towards enhanced democracy instead of uncontrolled market dominance? The course will specifically examine the phenomenon of globalization through the twin lenses of India and of Hinduism. India! is par ticularly appropriate since it is the largest democracy in the world and Hinduism has spread far and wide through the Indian Hindu diaspora.The course will deal with a range of material on globalization and global culture, bringing to the foreground current debates on transformation of religion in diasporic communities, cultural flows, de-territorialization, the rise of nationalism, and the role of religion in the globalizing world. This course intends to provide the student with a broad based view of the wide range of opinions and debates prevalent about globalization today. Thus there will emphasis on many apparently divergent phenomena, with students encouraged to question the nature of relation between these phenomena.

On the one hand, we will explore the ways in which cultural anthropologists pose questions, provide answers, and relate claims and evidence. On the other hand, we will examine "schools of thought" or "research paradigms" and the distinctive framings and languages of interpretation and analysis they offer of social life, culture, and politics. At issue in the course will the interplay of fieldwork, theory, and ethnographic narratives as different aspects of anthropological inquiry, We will be especially interested in the kinds of theory that cultural anthropologists have brought to bear on their different research interests and the reshaping of theory as it is appropriated from other fields.

    :description: "The course explores the city as a site for the negotiation of cultural diversity and the re-conceptualization of community. Drawing on a variety of historical and ethnographic studies, we examine how urban life conditions the production and reproduction of culture and the relation of such processes to larger structures of capitalism, technology, globalization, as well as social and artistic movements. Throughout the course, methodological questions regarding the city as an object of historical and ethnographic study are highlighted. We focus our analysis through attention to the city in general as well as both Washington D.C. and NYC in particular, in order to situate the region \xE2\x80\x93 and the nation \xE2\x80\x93 amid the conditions and processes affecting the entire globe."

    :number: "227"
    :description: "With the demise of the old Western imperialisms especially after World War II, and the collapse of the Soviet Bloc in the late twentieth century, nations everywhere have tended to re-organise themselves into new regionalist political/economic groupings (e.g. EU, NAFTA), and to assert corresponding ethnic/cultural identities (e.g. \xE2\x80\x98European\xE2\x80\x99, \xE2\x80\x98North American\xE2\x80\x99) intended to override existing differences. Inspired by Benedict Anderson\xE2\x80\x99s (1983) equation of nineteenth century nationalist ideologies with \xE2\x80\x98imagined communities\xE2\x80\x99, and Arjun Appadurai\xE2\x80\x99s (1990) account of \xE2\x80\x98imagined worlds\xE2\x80\x99 in the present-day global cultural economy, this course will examine how over recent decades New Zealand has redefined itself as \xE2\x80\x98a Pacific nation\xE2\x80\x99, and why in turn Pacific Islands nations generally have cautiously accepted New Zealand\xE2\x80\x99s regionalist identity assertions and associated leadership assumptions. The course will be divided into three parts, each dealing with a separate theme: first, Polynesian and European settlements of the Pacific Islands and New Zealand; second, New Zealand\xE2\x80\x99s record as a colonial and postcolonial overlord in the Eastern Pacific; and third, current relations between New Zealand and the so-called \xE2\x80\x98zone of failed states\xE2\x80\x99 in the Western Pacific. Student assignments will focus on the role of other external powers (e.g. USA, Chile, France, Australia, Indonesia, China, Japan) in the South Pacific, and the role there of both regional and global organisations (e.g. South Pacific Forum, UN, FAO, World Bank, IMF, Whaling Commission, Greenpeace)."

  - :name: Multiculturalism & Urban Life in Australia
    :number: "228"
    :description: Australia is a laboratory for understanding many issues in modern urban life including the dilemmas of the so-called "multicultural society." How may people and groups who share few cultural traditions live together for the well-being of all? How may a nation emerge from diverse language, religious, and cultural traditions? Since the days of the penal colonies, Australian urban institutions (most notably, state and national governments) have actively struggled with these questions, particularly as they affect Australia's equalitarian ethos. Opening with a new study of women prisoners on transport ships and the penal colony of New South Wales, the course traces the impact of the multicultural debate on the lives of Aborigines, "new" and "old" Australians. By studying Anzac Day, the Australian holiday commemorating the battle of Gallipoli, students will critically evaluate the impact of war on forging national identity in multicultural countries. Students will complete the course by examining the usefulness of new theories about the role of culture in modern nation states for understanding Australian urban life. (Not offered 2005-06)

By studying Aboriginal art and relationship to the land, the course will examine how the Aborigines interpreted and managed these events, including their development of a land rights movement during the late twentieth century. The course will end with a review of the government\xE2\x80\x99s activist management of Aborigines including the controversy about state-sponsored removal of part-Aborigines from their Aboriginal families, the emergence of Aboriginal fringe-camps on the outskirts of country towns and contemporary social issues such as alcohol consumption and domestic violence.

    :description: "This anthropology course provides an overview of the changing cultures, institutions, processes, and challenges in African societies, and it uses ethnographies to highlight some of the key socio-cultural issues now confronting Africans. There are three basic themes that run through the course and that help shape the materials presented: 1) a triple-heritage of Traditional African culture, Islamic culture, and Western Christendom exists, and accounts for the multiple, overlapping identities and continuities, and cultural adaptiveness all cross Africa; 2) the social institutions have a stable core, but they are also being reorganized as Africans attempt to preserve some aspects of existing structures, values and processes, while integrating other imported and global ones; and 3) many of the cultural conflicts and problems in contemporary Africa derive from the global-local interface, but must be approached in a fashion consonant with indigenous cultures and local-national needs. These are significant themes, some of which have been highly debated in the wider literatures of anthropology, social science, and political science. Yet, they become clearer as we examine a variety of cultures all across the Continent."

This course is an invitation to step back and think critically about what development means, and how gendered assumptions underpin development theory and practices. How do development policies sometimes preserve, and at other times, transform gender relations? How have women been studied and incorporated/co-opted into the field of development? We will engage with the political economic context of neoliberal globalization, theories of development, and transnational and postcolonial feminist critiques. This involves critically examining the founding binaries of the field, such as 'first world/third world', 'traditional/modern', 'productive/reproductive labor' and 'global/local.' Our readings include case studies of how women cope with, and resist, economic and social injustice. Topics addressed are (a) poverty alleviation strategies, micro credit and fair trade movements (b) population policies and reproductive rights (c) global assembly line work (d) tourism and the sex trade (e) AIDS and (f) the environment and sustainable development. By the end of the semester, we will have interrogated and compared gender relations in varied regions of the world, while pondering the question of how power works, in and through the field of development.

    :description: This seminar course takes an anthropological approach to the consideration of cultural issues being confronted within Africa today, and seeks to explore the intersections of indigenous cultural agency and national or internationally driven foreign policies. We first gain an understanding of how anthropologists have viewed continuity and change within African cultures, and then examine the dialogues between local, regional, and national levels of culture within different African societies. We use African case studies from development anthropology, political anthropology, and gender and development to see what type of policy issues arise over time. Drwaing on contemporary engaged anthropological approaches, we examine the strategies that different groups within particular African countries have attempted to address national problems such as economic restructuring, civil war or de-militarization, and inter-religious conflicts, emphasizing how they see the policy interface on these issues. We seek an answer to the question of whether the foreign policy arena has been concerned with the African cultural issues involved in health crises, conflict resolution, and international trade until the recent period, and how varying national interests have affected the culture/policy interface. Using digital video teleconferencing, our class will have regular conversations with U.S. Africa policymakers on these issues.

  - :name: Politics of Race and Ethnicity
    :number: "487"
    :description: "Latin America is a region of great racial, ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity. According to recent demographic surveys, there are over 40 million indigenous people and 120 million Afro-descendant people in Latin America, comprising over 40 percent of the region\xE2\x80\x99s population. In several countries, such as Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru, indigenous peoples comprise a majority of the country\xE2\x80\x99s rural population. While in other countries, such as Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, Afro-descendant people form a major part of both the rural and urban workforce. Despite this continuing presence of indigenous and Afro-descendant people, only recently have national constitutions begun to recognize the rights of these populations to maintain their ethnic and cultural identities, to be protected against racism and other forms of discrimination, and to be provided with equal access to land and to educational, employment and other opportunities. One of the major reasons for this recent recognition of the rights of indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples is the emergence of several new social movements whose main purpose has been to affirm the political, civil, and social rights of these peoples and to call for a more formal recognition of the multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-lingual nature of Latin American societies. There have also been several recent conferences, sponsored by the United Nations, the Organization of American States and other international agencies, which have led to a series of new international conventions and agreements calling for the combating of racial and ethnic discrimination and the recognition of cultural diversity. In a sense, for the first time in their histories, many Latin American countries are today faced by the challenge of creating truly multi-ethnic, multi-racial and multi-cultural democracies. A major purpose of this course will be to provide students with a systematic overview of the contemporary history of race and ethnic relations in Latin American countries; the political and social role which the new indigenous and Afro-descendant movements are playing in changing the images of these countries; and, the challenges which Latin American countries face in creating more equitable and inclusive democracies. The course itself will be open to both advanced under-graduates and graduate students and be conducted in a seminar format It will demand a relatively large amount of weekly readings, active class participation and the preparation of a mid-term essay assignment of 8 to 10 double-spaced pages in length and a final paper of 15 to 20 pages in length on racial and ethnic relations and government policies and programs in a specific Latin American or Caribbean country. In the first part of the course, we shall be reading three recent books on the general situation of indigenous peoples and Afro-descendant populations in Latin America. We shall then turn to more detailed discussions of Afro-descendant and indigenous movements and resulting government policies and programs in such countries as Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Guatemala and Mexico. We shall also consider how various international agreements such as the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous Peoples of 1989; the UN Conference Against Racism and Discrimination held in Durban, South Africa in September 2001; and, the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity approved at the 31st Session of the General Conference of UNESCO in Paris in November 2001 have affected the social policies and programs of Latin American countries in relation to the human and cultural rights of indigenous peoples and Afro-descendent populations. The course itself is currently scheduled to be held in ICC 116 on Monday evenings between 7 and 9 pm. Note: A more detailed Course Description and Class Schedule and Reading List for LASP 487-01 as given in the Fall 2005 semester is posted on the EXPLORE website for the course and will be minimally revised prior to the beginning of the course in September 2006.

    :description: This class focuses on the history and development of Islamic reform movements The first part of the semester will center on the life of the Prophet with a particular emphasis on his efforts at socio-ethical reform and his role as the political leader of a nascent religious community. The remainder of the course will examine how subsequent pre-modern movements/groups used this original template to justify their own versions of an ideal "Islamic" community. Topics will include a detailed study of the origins of Kharijism, the early Umayyad civil wars, the Abbasid Revolution, the creation of independent Zaydi states in Yemen and the Caspian, the rise of Ismailism as manifest in the creation of a Fatimid Caliphate and the Nizari "Assassin" order, the emergence of Shi'i political activism with the Safavid state, and the growth of apocalyptic reform movements as exemplified by the Babi movement in Iran.

    :number: "515"
    :description: "This course will examine language variation and change in the Arab world and the different factors that trigger change. The course will start by providing the framework for the study of variation and change: The concept of social class developed by Labov will be studied, then the concept of social networks by Milroy. Then the methods used by researchers in the West and the Arab world will be analysed and examined. There will be part of the course devoted to methodology and data collection. After familiarising students with both theories of variation and change and methods used by linguists, the course will concentrate on variables that influence language variation and the process of change. These variables will be examined in relation to studies done on the Arab world and with reference to studies done on other parts of the world. These variables include social class, ethnicity, religion, urbanization, gender, education and age group. One variable which does not play a major role in the studies done by Labov and others is diglossia, which is a feature pertaining to the Arab world. Therefore, there will be a section devoted to diglossia and its outcome, leveling."

    :number: "367"
    :description: "Virtually every country of the modern Islamic Near East is, or has been, ruled by dictators or authoritarian regimes. The explanation is not obvious: is dictatorship somehow endemic to the region; is it a necessary consequence of Islam or of established patterns of behavior; is democracy impossible? To answer these questions, this course will consider the historical background of the region and study the rise, careers and (where appropriate) fall of individual dictators. It will focus on the central Islamic lands, especially Egypt, Turkey and Iran, as well as Syria and Libya, with a brief survey of other countries of the region, with or without dictators. This is a colloquium, not a lecture course; it will require active student participation. For each class, a discussion leader will be chosen, to present the main topic and associated questions. Work will consist of oral reports, a short paper on an assigned topic, and a research paper of 20-25 pages on a topic of the student\xE2\x80\x99s choosing. There will be no exams. Spring."

    :number: "551"
    :description: This course would be based on a series of simulations. It would seek to teach the students how projects are actually negotiated in the Gulf, but also worldwide. The course will discuss the various financing techniques involved. However, it will also greatly emphasize how the governments, local investors, foreign investors, technology partners and banks have to interact in order to achieve the establishment of a new project. In fact real project finance is eminently political. It brings out competition between various governments to place their own technologies in the Gulf. It shows how savvy investors can play governments, banks and companies to get the best deal. The simulations will be run along basic scenarios, such as the establishment of a highly profitable, but obscure petrochemical in the Gulf using US technology, local investors, Chinese buyers, and bureaucratic government officials. The class would divided between the various actor and would negotiate the deal around a feasibility study which they would have to write. In my experience, these simulations are extremely well received by the students. I have run them in the US and in Europe with good success. Students discover that they do not have to be finance experts to actually negotiate project finance deals. Thus the simulations benefit political scientists, business majors, journalists and engineers alike.

The purpose of this course is not to elucidate any truths (with either a capital or lower-case \xE2\x80\x9Ct\xE2\x80\x9D). Nor is this course concerned with \xE2\x80\x9Cbashing\xE2\x80\x9D orientalists and orientalist writings or facile proclamations regarding the topic/problematic of \xE2\x80\x9Cterrorism.\xE2\x80\x9D Rather, we will trace the construction of these discourses and identify their basic theoretical assumptions and practical implications for the world in which we live. As such, the course will ultimately transcend the current \xE2\x80\x9Cwar on terrorism\xE2\x80\x9D to address the factors and dynamics that reproduce these and other discourses in a political context. Understanding the relationship between \xE2\x80\x9Cpower\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cknowledge,\xE2\x80\x9D between construction(s) of the \xE2\x80\x9Cself\xE2\x80\x9D and perceptions of the \xE2\x80\x9Cother,\xE2\x80\x9D are corollary objectives of the course.

These analytical journeys will involve extensive empirical observation/research and work conducted in the field by the instructor. Thus, this is a reading-, viewing-, and research-intensive course."

    :description: "This number will be used for colloquia devoted to specific subjects in the area of Middle East history. Students may take more than one of the courses offered under this number. Each course will be announced in the course schedule and receive its own sub-title. In Fall 2005 the following course is offered: Conservative Islam in the twentieth century: Throughout the twentieth century, Muslim scholars and activists across the Islamic world have chosen different ways of coping with the rapid changes brought about by modernity. While Islamic modernism and political Islam are possibly the most well known responses, this class is about a third one. The basic premise of conservative Islam is that religion does not need to be adapted or reinterpreted; it simply needs to be understood and practiced properly, that is, like the Prophet, his companions, and the imams of the first three generations of Islamic history understood and practiced it. The proponents of conservative Islam are not revolutionary, nor do they strive for the establishment of an Islamic state. They rather issue fatwas, focus on correct beliefs and proper devotional behavior, and endeavor to draw a clear border between what is Islamic and what is not. During the course, we will examine the ideas, significance, and evolution of this school of thought, while trying to understand how conservative Islam is different from both Islamic modernism and political Islam, and why it has gained ground in the past two decades. Some of our weekly themes will emphasize its pre-modern origins, its various manifestations, its relation to Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia, and its more recent radicalization."

The seminar begins with a brief introduction to the classical Islamic doctrine of the nature of the Qur'an; historical modes of interpretation and principles of exegesis; and some medieval and modern controversies regarding the Qur'an's history, nature, and authority. 2.) The main authors of the Sunni Qur'anic Tafsir literature are identified; in this segment, each student (or a study group of several students) chooses a specific _mufassir_ for in-depth analysis of this exegete's biography, work, socio-political setting and intellectual/theological background and methodology. 3.) The seminar focuses on several Qur'anic sociopolitical concepts (such as _qiwama_ and _shura_) with the aim to introduce the students to patterns of continuity and change in Qur'anic hermeneutics on these issues over time. The students locate the relevant passages in the many volumes of Tafsir works (on four hour reserve at Lauinger Library); thereafter copies of the text are distributed for reading/preparation of text by all seminar participants. 4.) Each seminar session has three parts: one, student presentation(s) on a _mufassir_ and the theological tradition to which he belonged; two, reading and translation of textual samples; reading is with full _i'rab_ to give all students the opportunity to read the texts in the culturally appropriate manner; three, the last segment of every seminar is dedicated to further exploration of the secondary literature on Qur'anic matters or other, relevant legal and historical issues."

This seminar will explore the construction in Lebanon of a consociational order based on traditional pluralism, and juxtapose it against the development of an ideologically radical, single-party populist-authoritarian system in Syria. It will focus in a comparative manner on religion and sectarianism, political institutions, executive power and the transfer of power, foreign influence, foreign policy, and the question of civil society.

It is part the history of doctrinal development, the ways in which Islamic jurists, working with received texts and sophisticated methodologies, formulated rules about women, men, and their relationships. It is part the history of legal institutions and practices, how these rules were understood, implemented, and even modified by a range of legal actors, from individual judges to centralized state powers. It is also part the history of lay members of Muslim communities whose choices of doctrines to follow and legal avenues to pursue allowed the law to develop in rhythm with social needs, just as their legal inquiries and court appearances also served, at times, as contestation of legal discourse on women and gender issues. We look at the historical evolution of basic legal doctrines, the range of legal practices in the Ottoman and modern (19th and 20th centuries) periods, and end with an examination some of the heated legal issue of today.

    :description: "This course will examine language variation and change in the Arab world and the different factors that trigger change. The course will start by providing the framework for the study of variation and change: The concept of social class developed by Labov will be studied, then the concept of social networks by Milroy. Then the methods used by researchers in the West and the Arab world will be analysed and examined. There will be part of the course devoted to methodology and data collection. After familiarising students with both theories of variation and change and methods used by linguists, the course will concentrate on variables that influence language variation and the process of change. These variables will be examined in relation to studies done on the Arab world and with reference to studies done on other parts of the world. These variables include social class, ethnicity, religion, urbanization, gender, education and age group. One variable which does not play a major role in the studies done by Labov and others is diglossia, which is a feature pertaining to the Arab world. Therefore, there will be a section devoted to diglossia and its outcome, leveling."

Class: Telephone : (202)-687-6226/4004 ICC. 204A O.hs: (ICC 475) Mon & Wed 2:00-2:40 p.m. W 4:15-6:45 p.m. by appointment: anytime saras@georgetown.edu Topic of the seminar: The topic of the seminar will be the Arab linguists who explicitly dealt with phonetic/ phonological issues. Treatises and sections of treatises that deal with phonetic/ phonological issues will be the topics for discussion. The seminar will emphasize the study of the earliest Arab phoneticians . The discussion will focus on the primary sources themselves. There are certain primary texts that come to us from the eighth century that are seminal for any discussion of the phonetics and phonology of Arabic. The two 8th century authors who were the architects of Arabic linguistics are Al-Khal?l and S?bawayh. Both have included in their linguistic writings detailed phonetic/ phonological treatises on Arabic that defined the parameters of these two sub-disciplines for subsequent centuries. Other authors, like Ibn Duraid and Ibn Sina 10th century , may be discussed in the seminar as time will permit. Purpose: To explore the origins and the development of the phonetic/ phonology in a new paradigm. When approaching a new tradition in linguistics, the challenge is to determine what makes that tradition original and unique in its contributions. What is of interest in this seminar, then, is to capture the creative genius of these linguists in providing the technical terminology and the analytical tools for the study of Arabic that are unique to this tradition. The task of this seminar will be to study their texts, explore their language data, isolate their technical terms, examine their procedures, capture their theoretical orientation, and evaluate the results of their efforts in the context of the overall linguistic theory and the study of Arabic in particular. Procedures: Seminars of this type are successful when the participants, without prejudice, tackle the problems, analyze the text, disentangle the underlying theoretical assumptions, and frame their results within the context of the language that is being analyzed. The success of this seminar will depend on the participation and contributions of all the members. Pre-requisites: Interest in the history of linguistics and interest in the Arab linguistic tradition. Knowledge of Arabic is Not required. All relevant Arabic sources will be provided in translation. Members of the seminar will be assigned sections of the texts for presentation, analysis, and discussion. Even though all members of the seminar will be responsible for all the texts, the more effective method of participation is to have a leader of the discussion for each meeting who will summarize the appropriate texts, present the issues discussed in that section, analyze it, and lead the subsequent discussion. Papers: Seminar evaluations do not depend on exams that require mastery of the basic materials. The evaluations depend on active participation in the seminar meetings, and original personal contributions to the topic of the seminar. Each member of the seminar will be required to write two short and one long final seminar papers on a phonetic/phonological topic both assigned and of their choice. The topic can be drawn from the materials discussed in class or may be analyses of phonetic/ phonological topics of a linguist from the same period not discussed specifically in class. Decision on the topic, with consultation with the professor, will be due by the beginning of march.

    :description: This course is essentially a reading course, designed to enable students who had 3 years of Arabic to plunge into the reading of complete stories of substantial length in order to start acquiring in-depth analytical, reflective, and fluent reading skills. Given the little time we have for class, the emphasis will be on self-reliant preparation. Students are expected to gain mastery of the texts almost independently, to develop their own responses, ask their own questions. This will facilitate the exchange of ideas in class. The course is also intended to explore some of "Nights'" common themes and narrative strategies. An important additional aim is to review and learn more salient points of grammar and build up vocabulary.

    :description: This course traces major trends in the history of Islamic science, medicine and technology from the rise of Islam to the early modern period. We will examine conceptual developments in the practice of science, and its position within Islamic culture. We will also assess various accounts for the beginnings of the Islamic scientific enterprise and the attitude of Islam towards the sciences. In particular, we will re-evaluate the standard periodization which posits a linear development of Islamic sciences starting with translation and assimilation of the Persian, Indian, and Greek scientific legacies; then, a period of original contributions; and, finally, transmission of Islamic sciences to Europe. The course will also examine ways in which the practice of science in Muslim societies contributed both to the preservation of the Greek sciences and to the gradual transformation of that scientific tradition. To appreciate the kinds of problems addressed by scientists in Muslim societies and the Islamic contributions to the general development of science, the course will outline some developments of Islamic science in the fields of medicine and the life sciences, optics, mechanics, mathematics and astronomy. Finally, the course will consider the historical narratives about the decline of Islamic science and modern Islamic responses to western science. We will read primary sources in translation as well as studies of specific historical and cultural aspects of science in the Islamic world.

The course then explores various models of Islamic political and social activism, and major themes addressed by leading thinkers of Islamic movements in the twentieth century. The focus is on Islamic movements from Egypt and the Arab Middle East, India/Pakistan, and Iran. Topics include the intellectual networks of scholars in the eighteenth century, the contexts of various forms of reform and revival, questions of continuity and European influence, the effects of the encounter with colonialism and imperialism, the attitude toward nationalism and other modern ideologies, and Islamic discussions of modernity and liberalism. In addition to background essays, we will read primary sources in translation; the selected texts are classics that have wide circulation within contemporary Islamic movements.

    :number: "493"
    :description: This course gives students practical experience in analyzing and describing an Arabic dialect. Students will draw on their theoretical knowledge of Arabic language and linguistics and apply that knowledge in their field work. We will begin with project design. This involves the intended purpose of the project and as well as issues such as recording, elicitation and transcription. The transcription process necessarily entails the study of phonology and will establish the basic phonemic set of the dialect. In building a glossary, students will consider questions of register, the influence of substrate language(s), and that status of borrowings. The description of morphology compares the dialect to Classical Arabic and Modern Standard Arabic. It examines word-building patterns that are lost in the dialect as well as those that are innovations. The study of syntax looks at phrases, especially agreement patterns and genitive structures. It also investigates sentence structure, including the use of pre-verbs and the structure of conditional sentences. Finally, we will explore discourse markers, those words and phrases that shape an entire utterance, and sociolinguistic issues such as code-switching, middle registers, and mixed codes.

The seminar begins with a brief introduction to the classical Islamic doctrine of the nature of the Qur'an; historical modes of interpretation and principles of exegesis; and some medieval and modern controversies regarding the Qur'an's history, nature, and authority. 2.) The main authors of the Sunni Qur'anic Tafsir literature are identified; in this segment, each student (or a study group of several students) chooses a specific _mufassir_ for in-depth analysis of this exegete's biography, work, socio-political setting and intellectual/theological background and methodology. 3.) The seminar focuses on several Qur'anic sociopolitical concepts (such as _qiwama_ and _shura_) with the aim to introduce the students to patterns of continuity and change in Qur'anic hermeneutics on these issues over time. The students locate the relevant passages in the many volumes of Tafsir works (on four hour reserve at Lauinger Library); thereafter copies of the text are distributed for reading/preparation of text by all seminar participants. 4.) Each seminar session has three parts: one, student presentation(s) on a _mufassir_ and the theological tradition to which he belonged; two, reading and translation of textual samples; reading is with full _i'rab_ to give all students the opportunity to read the texts in the culturally appropriate manner; three, the last segment of every seminar is dedicated to further exploration of the secondary literature on Qur'anic matters or other, relevant legal and historical issues."

Rather than presuming a \xE2\x80\x9CNorthern style\xE2\x80\x9D defined in contrast to the art of the Italian Renaissance, we will aim to understand regional and individual tendencies on their own terms. With emphasis on the work of major figures such as Van Eyck, Bosch, D\xC3\xBCrer, Holbein, and Bruegel, we will consider changing circumstances of the production, function, iconography, patronage, and commerce of art in the period.

  - :name: Looking at Photography
    :number: "627"
    :description: "Photography is many things: it is a technical process, a documentary tool, a personal memento, a form of art, a tool for propaganda, a device to generate commerce, or any combination of these elements. It is both an act and the thing created by that act. Its apparent subject matter can be portraiture, still life, landscape, couture fashion, historical artifact, criminal evidence, scientific data, or any combination thereof. Why photograph was taken and what it means to a viewer can vary wildly depending on its physical condition, its provenance, and the different \xE2\x80\x9Cgiven circumstances\xE2\x80\x9D (a term borrowed from the theatre) under which is was taken and under which it is viewed. The who, what, when, where, why, and how of these separate acts are frequently at odds with one another -- when they can be determined at all. Perhaps most importantly, photography is simultaneously ubiquitous and nearly invisible. From its earliest days, now nearly 200 years ago, photography has been thought of as a window on reality. Even the most sophisticated viewers tend to see the thing represented, accepting it as truth, while failing to see the thing that is the photograph itself, let alone the intellectual, artistic, technical, and political process of which it is the end result. But as the late Richard Avedon put it, \xE2\x80\x9CAll photographs are accurate. None of them is the truth.\xE2\x80\x9D The \xE2\x80\x9Cthingness\xE2\x80\x9D of the photograph and the multiple processes that create it affect our understanding of the thing represented. How the photographer sees affects what the viewer sees. This course will examine photography as both a way of seeing and a mode of rhetoric. We will approach the topic historically, but the markers of change over time \xE2\x80\x93 the technical innovations, the varying subject matter, and the generations of men and women who have made photographs for innumerable reasons \xE2\x80\x93 will not be considered as milestones of progress. Our purpose will not be to gauge the distance that separates us from photography's 19th century pioneers, Niepce, Daguerre, and Talbot \xE2\x80\x93 nor, for that matter, from such famous 20th century practitioners as Adams, Weston, or Evans. Rather, we will explore these historical markers as accretions, like the layers of a pearl, on the core human need to make images of the world."

    :description: "Take a work of contemporary architecture like Frank Gehry\xE2\x80\x99s Guggenheim Museum for Bilbao, Spain, one of the most photographed and well-publicized structures in the world today. We'd probably all recognize it. In our age, with our media, we\xE2\x80\x99ve been brought up to be highly ] visually aware, in a global sense. But how experienced are we in the means and methods of perceiving and analyzing our surroundings in three dimensions \xE2\x80\x93 proportions, light, spatial modulation, sequence, form, materials? This course aims to provide just such a foothold. We will be focused on hows and whys, and not so much the whats and whens. Frequent site visits to local spaces and buildings will allow us to examine a really diverse set of buildings here in Washington remarkable for their spatial and architectural aspects, such as the center of Washington, DC, as planned by Pierre L\xE2\x80\x99Enfant and Wright\xE2\x80\x99s Pope-Leighey House. We will see how they unfold spatially, how they deal with light and materials, how we occupy them. One of the main goals of this course is to develop, in the words of LeCorbusier, \xE2\x80\x9Ceyes with which to see\xE2\x80\x9D -- a goal to continue over a lifetime."

    :description: "The seminar will be an intensive introduction to the art of Albrecht D\xC3\xBCrer (1471-1528) and to some of the staggering range of interpretive effort it has attracted. D\xC3\xBCrer's work as a painter, printmaker, publisher, and theorist established him as one of the most influential artists of the western tradition. His impact was immediate and widespread, and has taken many shapes since the sixteenth century. One of the appeals of D\xC3\xBCrer for modern observers is the breadth and depth of his engagement with any number of historical and intellectual spheres. We will, for example, consider his work with regard to religion (changing devotional currents, the fledgling Reformation, etc.); local culture (German identity, gender relations, witchcraft, humanism, etc.); international travel and 'publicity' (mainly in Italy and the Netherlands); radical reformulation of the very idea of the artist as a unique individual (via self portraiture and the distribution of monogrammed prints, etc.); and other dimensions. The seminar does not require students' previous study of D\xC3\xBCrer, but some coursework in Renaissance and later art history, or in related fields, will be a significant help."

Some topics to be considered are: the invention of cubism; the origins of abstract art and the reasons for the rebirth of abstraction in the post WW II era; the dadaist redefinition (or de-definition) of art; the interactions of pop art and pop culture, the first manifestations of conceptual art. As we study the contexts for stylistic changes, we will identify circumstances in 20th century history that had multi-faceted and far-reaching effects on art, for instance, the two World Wars and subsequent wars, the Great Depression and the U.S. government\xE2\x80\x99s programs for employing art and artists, the Civil Rights movements, and the rise of global economies and forms of communication.

    :description: (Core Math/Science Course) The central theme of this course is the role of genes in evolution and in the expression of two intriguing physiological functions, immunity and mind. The Central pedagogical process is the presentation of observations which will lead to the formulation of hypotheses as to how genes can account for evolution, immunity, and mind. This strategy aims to develop understanding of central principles of biology. Emphasis is given to group work that leads to problem solving, the development of hypothetical biological models, critiques of these models, and comparison of these models with real biological solutions. The course focuses on how genes participate in evolution, how genes specify toads or professors, and ultimately, how genes direct the progressively more complex cell functions of the immune response and information processing within the nervous system. These course topics are used to engage the student in the complex properties of biological systems which emerge from the gene-directed reductionist perspective of live. This course is regarded as a core course for completion of the math/science requirement of the College. Two 75-minute lectures and one two-hour discussion per week. Spring.

Humans are a problem for the geneticist. We don't do experiments on ourselves; therefore, the variation available for study is limited to that occurring naturally in the population. The genetic basis of aging, development, cell proliferation, growth, and death is better understood in model organisms such as mouse, chick, and even fruit flies. Beginning with approaches based on formal genetics, we will study how genetics and molecular biological research using model organisms has led to a greater understanding of the human genetic system, including the study of disease, transcriptional regulation, and evolution.

  - :name: Japanese Catholicism
    :number: "137"
    :description: "Catholicism has a history in Japan longer than the United States has been a nation. Beginning with the arrival of St. Fr ancis Xavier in 1549, Catholicism has shaped Japanese culture in subtle but profound ways. This course seeks to enrich our understanding of Japanese culture by challenging stereotypes of Japanese culture as either \xE2\x80\x9Cnon-religious\xE2\x80\x9D (materialistic) or \xE2\x80\x9Cnot-our-religious\xE2\x80\x9D (Buddhist, Confucian, etc). Simultaneously, it challenges Eurocentric views that reduce Catholicism to an expression of Western culture. This course will emphasize the Catholic experience in modern Japan (defined as from 1868 to the present). Available English language sources focus on the postwar period (1945-present), and especially the writings of three important Catholic Japanese novelists. Readings in the past have included works by Endo Shusaku (whose manuscripts are housed in GU\xE2\x80\x99s library) such as Silence and A Life of Jesus. Silence is a historical novel that looks at the period of Catholicism\xE2\x80\x99s arrival in Japan in the mid 16th century, the horrific martyrdoms that occurred, and the struggle of faith for Japanese at that time. A Life of Jesus is Endo\xE2\x80\x99s imaginative reconstruction of the life of Jesus through his own self-consciously, Japanese sensibilities. We also have read fictional works like The Sting of Death, by Shimao Toshio (1917-1986) and No Reason for Murder by Sono Ayako (1922-1999). Background readings, including Pope John Paul II\xE2\x80\x99s Ecclesia in Asia, commentaries on the novels, and even films present a broader picture of the experience of the Catholic faith in modern Japan. Take a course at Georgetown that will introduce you to the culture that St. Francis Xavier struggled within his latter years! Course and readings are in English.

    :description: "The premise of this course is that the tradition of Catholic social teaching stands on the verge of an important new development in its approach to war and peace -- but one that has yet to be worked out. \"Catholic peacemaking,\" as it may be called, does not fit easily into traditional debates about war. Its focus is not on how to respond to discrete acts of injustice, but on how to help societies to seek the emerging opportunity of peace when it presents itself by seizing the moment and building on lessons learned from the destructive legacies of a violent past. What does the Catholic tradition have to say about actual acts of human destructiveness and about building a just order? What role do forgiveness and apology play? What role can the Church play? What relevance does this role have for politics? The course is unusual in giving students the opportunity to develop, not merely to study, a topic. Catholic approaches will be explored through theology, Christian history, case studies, and biography. Note: This course counts for a semester of the College Theology requirement."

During this course through lectures, museum visits, and field trips, we will consider \xE2\x80\x9Cthe politics of Christian art,\xE2\x80\x9D that is the transformations and symbological evolutions that result from new styles of governance or society, i.e., the imaging of Christ as Emperor following the declarations of Christianity as the religion of the Roman Imperium; or from the promulgation of official Church doctrines, i.e., the evolution of the Virgin Mary from simple maiden into the Theotokos as a result of the decrees of the Council of Ephesus. This new style of \xE2\x80\x9Creading\xE2\x80\x9D Christian art will provide insights not only in the visual culture of Christianity but of the interconnections between art, culture, politics, and religion throughout the history of western Christianity. Course lectures/discussions will begin with a consideration of the symbological values present in Simone Martini\xE2\x80\x99s innovative depiction of The Annunciation. Class lectures and discussions will concentrate on \xE2\x80\x9Cthe politics of Christian art\xE2\x80\x9D through a chronological survey of Christian art from the 2nd/3rd-century catacombs and sarcophagi in Rome to the 5th/6th-century mosaics in Ravenna to Medieval manuscripts and cathedral architecture to such Florentine Renaissance masterpieces as Donatello\xE2\x80\x99s sculptures of David and Judith, Michelangelo\xE2\x80\x99s sculptures for the Medici Chapel Tombs. Special sessions will be devoted to Leonardo da Vinci\xE2\x80\x99s Last Supper and Michelangelo\xE2\x80\x99s Sistine Chapel frescoes.

    :number: "433"
    :description: "The last several decades have seen a resurgence of religion in world politics. Political science continues to focus attention on key questions of war and peace, democracy and dictatorship, and the state and the economy. Religion is not displacing those topics. But its resilience in advanced industrialized societies and its vibrancy in the developing world are casting established research agendas in a new light. International terrorism, for example, raises questions about the religious sources of violence. Drives for democratization and human rights focus attention on their compatibility or incompatibility with particular religious traditions. Breakthroughs in the life sciences set off political and religious controversies about the promise of technology and the sanctity of human life. And economic and political globalization generates contacts across cultures and creates new opportunities for interreligious conflict and cooperation. The course will explore the intersection of religion and politics in these four areas -- violence, democracy, science, and globalization. It will be heavy on theory: the very best efforts to conceptualize the intersection of religion and politics in a changing world. But it will also be problem driven. Working alone and in small groups, students will have a chance to explore particular controversies in-depth and relate them to the overarching themes of the course. Students who sign up for the course will be expected to do some background reading over the summer. [Comparative Politics]"

This course will engage directly with that question by surveying Irish society and culture from pre-Christian times down to the end of the old Gaelic order in 1607. We will examine Celtic society--its social structure, laws and literature--and then trace its impact on the Christianization of Ireland. We will look at the effect on Ireland of invasions by the Vikings and the Normans, and the establishment of English rule in Ireland. The class emphasizes active learning. Along with traditional lectures, there will be both discussions and structured exercises, with a focus on analyzing primary sources in their historical context. Instructions for in-class discussions and debates will be given in advance. Participation in class discussion is strongly encouraged and constitutes 15% of the course grade.

  - :name: Dante and the Christian Imagination
    :number: "276"
    :description: "The goal of this course is to consider the explicitly Christian and uniquely contemporary intellectual relevance of Dante's Commedia in the context of the questions of human freedom and personal identity, as well as the role of the imagination in the formation of culture and world views. The basis and substance of the study will be Dante's Commedia. The approach of the course to this theme will be interdisciplinary with significant consideration being given to the function of imagination as it operates in poetry, psychology, philosophy, and theology. The unifying element in this approach would be the role of metaphor in all these disciplines, with special attention to both the similarities and the specific difference of that role in each as it appears in the poem. We will read in translation and discuss substantial portions of all three of the Cantiche of the Commedia, Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. Students will be asked to make regular use of a website designed specifically for this course incorporating the text of the Commedia in Italian and English translation, as well as images from the rich history of the illustration of the poem by great artists and commentary on the text from a variety of sources. No prior expertise in web technology is required; students will, however, be asked to become familiar with and use a few basic techniques of interactive, web-based learning. 2. Assignments and Grading: --Maintain on-line \xE2\x80\x9Cjournal\xE2\x80\x9D of reflective commentary (50%) --Final paper, 10 pages, typed, double spaced.

    :description: "The central theme considered in the course is this: how does Catholic faith (as a religion of \"both/and,\" not \"either/or\") interact with various forms of human culture. The class will investigate Catholic tradition to see how it emerged from earlier, existing cultures and how it developed its own forms of cultural expression. We will in addition probe its relevance for contemporary society. We begin with narrative: the earliest stories about Jesus of Nazareth, the problems in reading them, and the central beliefs of Catholicism as they are derived from these accounts. After this overview, we look at four ways in which Catholicism has found expression within human cultural traditions. 1. Catholicism and society. What role do Catholics play in government and social organization and how does Catholicism relate its faith to public policy? We will read the American Bishops' Letter on the Economy of the USA. 2. Personal narratives. What meaning have people found in Catholicism in their own personal lives? Here we will read the autobiographies of St. Augustine [4th C.] and Dorothy Day [20th C.]. 3. The fine arts. How has Catholicism shaped aesthetic imagination? We will study the poetry, architecture, painting, and sculpture of Michelangelo. 4. The physical world. What can Catholicism say about nature, science, and present environmental concerns? We will consider authors such as Teilhard de Chardin and John Haught. There will be four concise student projects during the semester, one becoming a somewhat larger final essay. NOTE: This course satisfies one semester of the College Theology requirement."

    :number: "347"
    :description: In this colloquium we will explore the relationship of official religion to magic, approaches to the study of the natural world, and healing practices in Western Europe from late antiquity to the Scientific Revolution in the seventeenth century. Although the course will concentrate on ideas and events in Western Europe, important points of interaction between Christian and Islamic worlds will be taken up (the practice of alchemy, after all, received its name in the Arab world). Relying on historical documents and other evidence, we will place varieties of magic and superstition in historical context. Throughout the course we will examine underlying assumptions about God, the supernatural, the preternatural, and the natural. Because the role of superstition and magic receded -- but did not completely disappear -- by the seventeenth century, the course will address the reasons why much of what was normal and normative from antiquity to the Middle Ages became marginalized by the seventeenth century. At the same time, neither Christianity nor early modern science was intrinsically hostile to forms of magic; instead, both incorporated it in positive ways during their formative years. It is precisely this paradoxical combination of faith and reason on the one hand, and unreason on the other, that we will seek to understand in the course.

How does the four-fold allegorical method of interpreting \"The Comedy\", recommended by Dante himself, help us to understand the reality of life in 14th-century Italy. Is the reading of \"The Comedy\" an exercise in literary curiosity or does it possess the power to affect modern readers in our own lived reality? In order to address these and similar concerns, we will read translated selections from other works by Dante and his contemporaries and consider reactions to \"The Comedy\" from such perceptive readers as Boccaccio and T.S.

    :description: "This course surveys some of the major themes of ancient Greek and Medieval Philosophy: Knowledge and Opinion, Being and Becoming, God and the First Causes, Cosmos, Soul and Immortality, Reason and Faith. The continuity between the two periods will be stressed. We will read works of Parmenides, Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Proclus, Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and Aquinas.. Medieval Philosophy was born from the creative interaction of biblical faith with Greek philosophy. The issue, the relationship between philosophy and religious faith, is complicated because among western Christians, medieval philosophy mostly existed in the context of various theologies. But, throughout the course, we will consider the implications of \xC3\x89tienne Gilson's remark: \"A philosophy may draw inspiration from a revelation and be true, and if true, it is because it is good philosophy\" (Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1940], p. 406). Until the thirteenth century, Neoplatonism (which attempted to unify the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions) provided the dominant philosophical framework for speculative theology. The most illustrious of the Neoplatonists, Plotinus (205-270 A.D.), profoundly influenced Augustine (354-430), especially in regard to the mind's approach to divine reality through interior recollection. Augustine himself dominated subsequent western theology, as can be seen in the writings of Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109), until, in the late twelfth century, the translation and introduction of Aristotle into the Latin west provoked a philosophical revolution in regard to the prevailing Augustinianism. But the \xE2\x80\x9CChristian Aristotelianism\xE2\x80\x9D of Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), which marks a new stage in the development of medieval philosophy, was, in fact, a creative synthesis of the Augustinian-Neoplatonic tradition (especially as mediated through the Procline Neoplatonism of Pseudo-Dionysius) with Aristotle."

Major issues include the question of theological sources and canonicity, the doctrine of God, Christology, the Trinity, human freedom, heterodoxy, ecclesiology, and ritual. Central focus will be on primary texts, read with an eye toward their historical, cultural, and geographical contexts.

    :description: "This course examines the history and development of Christian thought and practice from the \"high\" Middle Ages (twelfth century) through the Reformation (sixteenth century), into the modern world and the turn of the twentieth century. Central focus will be on primary texts, read with an eye toward their historical, cultural, and geographical context. The course is divided into three parts: (1) Middle Ages. We shall begin with the twelfth-century renaissance, when cross- fertilization among Muslim, Jewish, and Christian scholars gave rise to new ways of doing Christian theology; we will study scholasticism and medieval mysticism. We shall also study the Crusades (the motivating factors, how they functioned in the imagination and piety of medieval Christian culture, their political and spiritual effects) and the fall of Constantinople in 1453. (2) Reformation. We shall study the Protestant and Catholic Reformations of the sixteenth century, studying not only the theology but also the social and political repercussions. We shall start with precursors to the reformation and then focus in particular on Martin Luther, John Calvin, the Council of Trent, and Ignatius of Loyola. (3) The Modern Period. We shall focus on problems of articulating Christian faith in the context of the modern world, its view of history, which seems inconsistent with revelation; its scientific methods; and its emphasis on the individual and individual rights."

The course is structured around case studies and primary materials, and its goal is to shed light on legal, institutional, intellectual, and cultural developments in the West: we will begin chronologically with the Athenian condemnation of Socrates and conclude with the Church\xE2\x80\x99s seventeenth-century condemnation of Galileo. Intervening topics include medieval heresy, civil suppression of heresy, judicial torture, and the Inquisition. Throughout the course, we will be attempting to define and understand historically such western concepts as social consensus, right authority, tradition, dissent, and heterodoxy. We will also be investigating the role that ideological uniformity plays in social cohesion and the extent to which opposition to orthodoxy is not merely to set oneself in opposition to civil and religious authorities, but also to a whole culture.

    :number: "338"
    :description: "In 1951, the then Monsignor Giovanni Battista Montini, later Pope Paul VI, suggested to future papal diplomats that diplomacy, especially papal diplomacy, might be defined as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe art of creating and maintaining international order, that is, peace.\xE2\x80\x9D More specifically, he described diplomacy as \xE2\x80\x9Cthe art of establishing human, rational and juridical relations among peoples, not by force or inexorable contrast and balance of interests, but by open and responsible regulation.\xE2\x80\x9D The present course seeks to sketch a mosaic of principles for peace on the basis of the Messages for the annual World Day of Peace published by Popes Paul VI, John Paul II and Benedict XVI. Close analysis of these Messages and a synthetic distilling of the principles contained in them can offer contemporary diplomacy a rich storehouse of rational tools for negotiation and conflict resolution. After examining the 1951 speech of Monsignor Montini, the course will trace the origins of the \xE2\x80\x9CWorld Day of Peace\xE2\x80\x9D, inaugurated by Pope Paul VI in 1968, group the 39 annual Messages for that Day according to their thematic content, analyze the contents of each Message in its immediate historical context, draw \xE2\x80\x9Cprinciples of peace\xE2\x80\x9D from it, sketch a synthetic \xE2\x80\x9Cmosaic\xE2\x80\x9D of the principles drawn from all the Messages and examine possible applications of them in concrete situations."

  - :name: Introduction to Catholic Ethics
    :number: "104"
    :description: "\"Catholic ethics,\" as it is the subject matter of this course, refers solely to the philosophical effort, by Roman Catholics, to understand--apart from any appeal to revelation, supernatural faith, or ecclesiastical authority--what is morally good for all men and women, whether Christian believers or not. Traditional Catholic philosophical ethics is a \"natural law ethics\" whose historical sources can be traced to Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, and which was synthesized and clarified in the 13th century by Thomas Aquinas. However, secular philosophers widely ignore or reject natural law ethics, and some present-day Roman Catholic ethicists regard traditional, Catholic, natural law ethics as promising too much and delivering too little. Moreover, current discussion of difficult moral issues, such as abortion, birth control, in vitro fertilization and transfer of embryos, surrogate motherhood, cloning, non-marital heterosexual or homosexual sexual activity, and homosexual marriage, poses many philosophical challenges to traditional Roman Catholic philosophical ethics. What, then, can a contemporary Roman Catholic natural law ethics say in response? In particular, we shall look sympathetically but critically at the philosophical answers of two important Roman Catholic authors, Germain Grisez and John Finnis. Spring."

    :description: "St. Augustine (354\xE2\x80\x94430) is a giant of Christian thought, but his profound influence on subsequent philosophy is often not sufficiently recognized. Augustine is one of the most frequently cited thinkers in the middle ages; in the modern period, Descartes\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy is thoroughly imbued with ideas from Augustine. The concern of this course is to explore Augustine\xE2\x80\x99s thought on a range of philosophical issues on which he influenced later thinkers and developed ideas that are important in their own right. These include freedom of the will and, more broadly, philosophical psychology; the nature of the soul and mind; the existence and nature of God; creation and time; knowledge and skepticism. Turning to areas of a more practical concern, we shall consider Augustine\xE2\x80\x99s views on happiness, the nature of the state, his contributions to the ethics of homicide, including the doctrine of the just war, and sexual ethics Texts & Readings We shall read a wide range of Augustine's works, including, but not limited to, \"On the Free Choice of the Will\", parts of the \"Confessions\" \"The City of God\" and \"On the Trinity,\" \"Against the Academic [skeptics]\", \"On the Happy Life,\" \"The Good of Marriage\".

    :description: "Modern Chinese drama--\"Huaju\" (word drama)--features realistic spoken dialogue rather than the sung poetic dialogue of the traditional Chinese dramatic forms. It resembles Western-style stage drama and often contains social commentary. In addition to readings on the history of modern Chinese drama, we will spend most of the time reading three representative modern plays and watching videotaped performances of them: Thunderstorm (Cao Yu's script, 1936), The Teahouse (Lao She's script, 1957), and Bird Men (Guo Shixing's script, 1997). We will pay close attention to cultural meanings and to the use of language, particularly Beijing dialect, in both the written scripts and the stage performances. Conducted in Chinese.

  - :name: Introduction to Communication, Culture and Technology
    :number: "505"
    :description: "This course serves as an interdisciplinary introduction to the many of the animating questions of the Communication, Culture and Technology program. Central to these questions is the nature of agency in the contemporary communications and media environment: which actors and historical forces shape the design, movement and reception of different media forms? How does the difference among these forms (telephony, radio, film, television, the internet, etc.) affect the ways that they function in the daily life of individuals and social groups in different historical moments and in the present? How do questions of social difference (nationalism, regionalism, class, sex/gender, race) come into play in how media facilitate (or sometimes, don't) democratic interactions among producers, consumers, citizens and their government? How effective is government as an instrument of our presumed agency? What models of historical change help to understand the relations among all these actors and forces? The course is organized into three related modules: production, distribution and consumption, and in each module faculty and students examine different intellectual traditions in order to discover substantial differences and important convergences among these traditions. In each module, faculty will present readings that showcase critical and theoretical approaches to the study of media technologies; students will then be responsible for working in small groups in order to present instances of contemporary media that they want to examine in the context of these approaches. The emphasis in these modules is not upon deciding whether any approach in necessarily more effective or convincing, but to refine and distinguish a language that brings all of them into dialog. The teaching assistant schedule is: T - 630-730 - Derrick T - 630-730 - Kevin W - 540-640 - Dora W - 615-715 - Graham R - 540-640 - Nisha R - 615-715 - Katie"

    :description: The goal of the course is to examine the public policies, legal and political structures that currently determine democratic deliberation in the U.S. Rather than looking at media as a consumer product, a means of entertainment or as a business, this course will focus on the political relationship between citizens and media/telecommunications companies. The course will require readings (roughly half a book per week) that explore the constitutional and regulatory structures that determine the character of this political relationship, the history and theories behind these structures, and present battles over media concentration and telecommunications infrastructure. Preparation and participation are required for this seminar. My goal is for the student to develop a clear understanding of how public policy shapes and is in turn shaped by the structure of communication at the local, state and national level. Two 10-15 page papers and a group project will determine the grade.

    :number: "627"
    :description: "Photography is many things: it is a technical process, a documentary tool, a personal memento, a form of art, a tool for propaganda, a device to generate commerce, or any combination of these elements. It is both an act and the thing created by that act. Its apparent subject matter can be portraiture, still life, landscape, couture fashion, historical artifact, criminal evidence, scientific data, or any combination thereof. Why photograph was taken and what it means to a viewer can vary wildly depending on its physical condition, its provenance, and the different \xE2\x80\x9Cgiven circumstances\xE2\x80\x9D (a term borrowed from the theatre) under which is was taken and under which it is viewed. The who, what, when, where, why, and how of these separate acts are frequently at odds with one another -- when they can be determined at all. Perhaps most importantly, photography is simultaneously ubiquitous and nearly invisible. From its earliest days, now nearly 200 years ago, photography has been thought of as a window on reality. Even the most sophisticated viewers tend to see the thing represented, accepting it as truth, while failing to see the thing that is the photograph itself, let alone the intellectual, artistic, technical, and political process of which it is the end result. But as the late Richard Avedon put it, \xE2\x80\x9CAll photographs are accurate. None of them is the truth.\xE2\x80\x9D The \xE2\x80\x9Cthingness\xE2\x80\x9D of the photograph and the multiple processes that create it affect our understanding of the thing represented. How the photographer sees affects what the viewer sees. This course will examine photography as both a way of seeing and a mode of rhetoric. We will approach the topic historically, but the markers of change over time \xE2\x80\x93 the technical innovations, the varying subject matter, and the generations of men and women who have made photographs for innumerable reasons \xE2\x80\x93 will not be considered as milestones of progress. Our purpose will not be to gauge the distance that separates us from photography's 19th century pioneers, Niepce, Daguerre, and Talbot \xE2\x80\x93 nor, for that matter, from such famous 20th century practitioners as Adams, Weston, or Evans. Rather, we will explore these historical markers as accretions, like the layers of a pearl, on the core human need to make images of the world."

    :description: "How does English literature change as we move from oral to scribal to print culture--annd from the material to the digital text? How did the serialization of Victorian novels in periodicals affect their composition, distribution, and readership? And how is the literary history of particular eras inflected by such cultural influences as law, economics, and technology? Such questions are central to \"The History of the Book\"\xE2\x80\x94that is, the understanding of literary texts as both material artifacts and potentially disembodied (electronic) forms. This course offers students of literature an opportunity to explore some of the cultural and historical concepts behind such issues as literary authorship, forgery, piracy, translation, production, dissemination, and audience. It provides the historical foundation underlying several central debates within current literary theory, including the unstable status of the author, the gendered politics of literary publication, the economics of book distribution, the shifting definition of literary textuality, the history of literary censorship, and the legal evolution of copyright and hypertext in the Digital Age. In order to bring these issues into focus, we will read some influential literary works that stand as particular examples and illustrations within the History of the Book. In addition to landmark examples by Chaucer, Defoe, Sterne, Pope, Blake, Wordsworth, Byron, Hemans, Austen, Dickens, and the Brontes, we will also trace some of the more recent and experimental developments within literary textuality and hypertext. Theoretical readings will include essays by Foucault, Benjamin, Derrida, Borges, Habermas, Darnton, Sutherland, Eisenstein, Eaves, McGann, Woodmansee, Negroponte, Landow, Drucker, and Hayles, among others."

This course explores how government policy shapes the development of communications services. Specifically, the course investigates issues such as the social significance of communications services; economic policy challenges, such as the transition from monopoly to competitive markets and international trade in services; and political concerns such as the role of regulatory institutions and the blurring of national borders because of technological change. Case studies will be drawn from every region of the world, from countries at varying levels of economic development. Case studies will also look at a range of communications services, including telephony, television, and the Internet. Students will learn how to identify policy concerns, analyze relevant information, and develop approaches to address problems. Class assignments are designed to give students opportunities to practice presenting policy views, supported by data, both verbally and in writing.

    :description: "There are no sites of identity more intense, more personal, and more contentious than the intersection of gender, sexuality and the body. In the seminar we will address the ways that the body becomes a locus for the conflict and negotiation of public social, cultural, economic, historical norms and values with private spheres of love, intimacy, romance, friendship, sexuality, and gender. We will use work by Sigmund Freud, Michel Foucault, Juergen Habermas, Judith Butler, Lauren Berlant and Eve Sedgwick, David Halperin to establish the critical categories for our inspection of identity construction. Then, we will survey some of the general theoretical literature on feminism, masculinity, gender, sexuality, and the body as it informs notions of identity, particularly when intersecting with race and ethnicity (the Jewish, Black, or Asian body) on nationalism (the Israeli \x1Cmuscle Jew\x1D or the Aryan/Nazi body) or medicine (the sick, disabled, or altered body) We will also address various constructions of gender/sexuality/body in hetero/homo/bisexuality, transvestism and transgenderism, as well as particular issues that highlight complicated and controversial negotiations for individuals (private sphere) with society (public sphere) around power, domination, and authority, such as pornography and s/m. We will use various genres such as film, literature, art, television, advertising and other media where such public representations appear and bring issues dealing with gender, sexuality and the body into the public's imagination. Substantial reading, writing, and discussion will be required. In order to facilitate a research project, an abstract, literature review, and final paper or prospectus will also be expected."

Indeed technologies have inspired new ways of being in the world that challenge and complicate cultural conceptions of gender, identity, democracy, nationality, community, and truth (to name just a few) on an unprecedented level that are worthy of investigation. This seminar examines technologies from a rhetorical perspective that turns our attention to the culturally distinct ways technologies are represented and come to have meaning by and through language. The rhetorical construction of technology is an important area of inquiry because the way we communicate about objects, ideas, and processes reflects deep cultural commitments, values, and ideologies that often have important political and ethical implications. Rather than focusing on objects alone, this course takes a broad approach to technologies examining them both as artifacts (e.g. the blackberry) and techniques/processes (e.g. the assembly line). Embedded in this rhetorical approach to technology is an interest in history, power, and culture as they help to illuminate technology in our era. As such, we will read widely from cultural studies, critical theory, social theory, and science and technology studies. Course Objectives: Through course readings, discussion, a collaborative book review/presentation and a final project, students will leave this course with a working knowledge of (1) the broad history of the social/cultural study of technology, (2) the distinction between technology as artifact and technique, (3) what it means to say that technology is rhetorical and finally (4) the ability to perform a rhetorical criticism of technologies and technological systems. Course Readings: We will be reading selections from Mumford, Ellul, Habermas, Foucault, Latour and Traweek, Haraway, Hables Gray, Bijker, Pinch, and Woolgar, Feenberg, Du Gay et al, Rushing and Frentz, Brummett, Taylor and others."

    :description: Journalists, professors, authors and creative workers are increasingly required to work in environments that call for greater technical aptitude. Computer programming skills are required to make creative use of the full range of communication options available in our web-enabled world. To that end, this course will teach students basic object-oriented programming skills, with a focus on web-related development topics. Throughout the course, key concepts will be introduced that will help students think critically about technical issues with respect to communication. Examples include XML and the Document Object Model (DOM), the separation of content from design, localization, and version control. The course will also cover project management topics and introduce agile programming methodologies such as pair programming, where two people work side-by-side and share the task of writing code. No programming experience is required, but students should be comfortable with computer terminology and the world wide web.

In addition to an introductory unit, three broad areas of concern serve as the foundation of this course: \"Political Philosophy, Political Theory and Popular Music(Introduction),\" \"Music and the State,\" \"Music and Political Culture\" and \"Music as Political Action.\" The course will be taught as a seminar with both students and the professor as active participants in the learning process. We will explore many pop music genres and students are encouraged to incorporate their own music interests into their independent research projects. So if you love music and you love politics, this is the course for you. Background in music theory is not essential- but music listening skills are critical. In addition to the course readings, students will be required to listen to a considerable amount of music and/or watch music videos for the purpose of class discussion and possibly for the completion of some assignments.

  - :name: Network Technologies and Society
    :number: "742"
    :description: "New technologies create new possibilities. Hence, they change our expectations about what people can and cannot accomplish, and what we should and should not do. In fact, we have often looked to the development of new technologies to resolve societal problems that heretofore have had no ready solution. However, past efforts to correctly anticipate the eventual uses and impacts of new technologies have all too often fallen short of the mark. For example, early on many thought that the telephone would be a broadcasting device! The gap between expectations and actual experience with new technologies can be explained, in part, by our limited understanding of the relationship between technology and society. Attempts to depict this relationship have typically been one dimensional, focusing either on technology as a driving force or on a particular set of social forces that are believed to preordain the evolution of technology. Experience has proven such conceptualizations to be far too simplistic; and the consequences of relying on them have been costly. Lacking an adequate understanding of technological development we\xE2\x80\x94as a society\xE2\x80\x94have been unaware of the choices available. Thus, we are often unable to channel technological developments in the most positive directions. Moreover, people have been reluctant to take adequate responsibility for the choices that we make\xE2\x80\x94often treating technological development as \xE2\x80\x9Cdetermined\xE2\x80\x9D by forces beyond social control, intractable to reasoned deliberation. Today we are witnessing profound changes in communication systems worldwide, brought about, in part, by innovation in a wide range of information and communication technologies. Because communication is central to much of what people do, these new technologies are likely to have a profound effect on our social, economic, and political circumstances. If we are to maximize the potential of human development, we will need to improve our analytical skills for assessing the range of choices available, an for understanding the constraints under which such choices are made. This course addresses these issues. In it, we will consider existing models of the relationship between technology and society. In addition, we will look at the emergence of new digital medial in the context of these models. The implications for society will also be addressed, as will the possibilities for affect future technological scenarios."

    :description: "The ethnography of communication documents and analyzes communicative practices and investigates how they fit into broader social context. Such communicative practices run the gamut from ritual invocations to ancestral spirits to idle gossip, and from complex peace negotiations to the conventional 'hello'. Ethnographers of communication also examine the complexities of communication between observers and the people they study. This course provides both theoretical and hands-on experience with a range of different methods for collecting data on communication and language in social context. The fieldwork will take place in Washington, DC metropolitan area, where small groups of students select a communication site as their primary fieldwork area. As a researcher in training, you may choose any site to develop your project, including a classroom, courtroom, corporation, health care clinic, mediation center, airport, church, fitness center, AIDS residential facility, post office, Congress, soup kitchen, restaurant, support group, library or any other. Through your fieldwork, you will learn about ethnography (participant observation), structured observations, interviews, narrative/oral history and rapid anonymous surveys. Our understanding of the value of each method will be enhanced through mini-phenomena frequently studied by sociolinguists and communication specialists, and discussion and assessment of each method in terms of issues such as \"record\" keeping ( e.g. field notes vs. checklists), objectivity/subjectivity, transcription, coding, and the relationship between theory and methodology. Students will also gain hands-on experience with other types of data (e.g. videotape, internet) and carry out analysis based on that data. Course requirements include participation in class discussions, reading articles that are based on different types of data, discussion of the fieldwork, completion of the fieldwork project, a personal journal (recounting and evaluating your fieldwork and its specific phases/projects), and a group report on your field study.

Our themes will include the cultural encoding of the material forms media, mediation and cultural transmission, the rhetoric of communication and information technologies, and the institutional and social contexts of media and the visual arts. Readings will include seminal works in semiotics and discourse analysis, rhetoric, cultural theory, the sociology of media and technology, post-postmodern cultural theory, and contemporary theory in the visual arts. We'll cover many of the \"greatest hits\" in theory since the 1960s so that everyone will have a common background, but then move beyond received academic theory to real-world questions and applications. We will look closely at the work of Regis Debray and the model of mediology, which proposes a metatheory of communication and media that usefully combines history, technology, culture, and politics. Grading and weekly seminar assignments will be based on student presentations, applied theory projects, and a final project involving the application of a theoretical mode to a contemporary case. Students will be expected to create the seminar in real time through readings, discussion, and proposal of cases and examples for study (see course hypersyllabus).

    :number: "773"
    :description: "The purpose of this course is to understand the structure and development of network industries. Network industries have significant network effects, economies of scale, switching costs and a crucial role for standards. As a result of these characteristics, network industries differ in key economic ways from other industries. In particular, they tend toward concentration, and follow a pattern of competition followed by widespread business failures and then consolidation. Government involvement in these industries through antitrust, price and entry regulation and intellectual property rules also crucially affects their structure and history. There are two major categories of network industries: physical networks, which involve either one-way or two-way physical connections among the network participants and \xE2\x80\x9Cvirtual\xE2\x80\x9D networks, which do not involve physical interconnection of their participants, but which behave economically very much like physical networks. The first part of the course introduces and illustrates these basic concepts, in particular the crucial notion of network effects and the related ideas of increasing returns to scale and positive feedback. We will discuss network effects as a type of externality and the idea that network industries can exhibit path dependence where chance historical events lock an industry into an undesirable outcome. The second part of the course applies these concepts to various industries, including telephones, the Internet, video distribution (broadcasting, cable and satellite television), computer software, consumer information services, video games, motion pictures, recorded music, payment cards and airlines. A theme of the course is the way in which their character as network industries affects their history, their market structure and the conduct of their participants."

  - :name: Designing Interdisciplinary Research
    :number: "787"
    :description: "This course focuses on the intellectual design and preparation of research projects in the interdisciplinary humanities and humanistic social sciences. Students will engage with the literature on project design as well as consider issues of interdisciplinarity from a practical and a theoretical perspective. Students will work on honing their thesis project ideas, crafting research plans, and conducting a literature review. Students will produce three projects: 1) an online \"evidence\" portfolio which represents an ongoing design for an interdisciplinary research project and engages in some initial engagement with evidence [see examples from last year] <http://lumen.georgetown.edu/projects/postertool/index.cfm?fuseaction=poster.fullList&instanceID=67> , 2) a completed thesis proposal (drawn from the content of the evidence portfolio) and 3) a literature review draft as preliminary to the writing of a project. This course is especially useful to those writing a thesis in the Spring, as the design of an evidence portfolio is a solid way to begin thinking through the issues which go into the production of a thesis. PLEASE NOTE: Starting with 2007, this course no longer counts as a research methods course. Students will NOT learn research methods in this course, but rather how to design and plan projects using appropriate methods taken from their (inter)disciplinary backgrounds."

  - :name: The Technological Imagination
    :number: "792"
    :description: Human visions of technology have informed how we construct and destroy our civilization from the time of Plato's Republic to More's Utopia and onward. Where once we knew everything about our neighbors but little about the world beyond our backyard, now we can know nearly everything about anyone within the machine of society (or think we can, in any case). Thanks to the variant technologies of surveillance, destruction, genetic manipulation, incarceration & control, psy-ops, space travel and even trans-humanism, we envision our future and re-envision our past through an increasingly technical hermeneutical lens. In this course, we will address how we have developed this lens and thus how we have created the society that corresponds (or avoids) the vision we construct. The Technological Imagination will use two and three dimensional artifacts and texts to lend insight and flavor to discussions. This course is a seminar and as such students will lead the discussion on a given week. Classes may also include some lecturing to complement in-class discussion. The class will include weekly viewings of various films appropriate to the class.

    :description: "This course will examine the product planning cycle. Students will learn about the product planning process and will apply these concepts toward the development of an individual product plan. The course will start with a discussion of the popular and professional notions of product and service within the context of today\xE2\x80\x99s digital age. After this, the individual components of a typical product plan will be introduced. As the semester progresses students will develop their own product plans as these various plan components are reviewed. These components include the following: product description; target market; competitor analysis; technology trends; financial statements; business case development; product evolution; and exit strategies. At the conclusion of the course, students will understand the product planning process; know the various components of a product plan; and appreciate the elements of basic product-related financial statements. Homework assignments will be geared towards the development of particular components of each student\xE2\x80\x99s product plan. A mid-term test will examine each student\xE2\x80\x99s understanding of specific product planning concepts."

    :description: "This course is designed to make you think critically about the diverse research approaches for studying communication, culture and technology. The course is ideally suited for four tasks: understanding the role and trends of research in communications, evaluating the basis for the conflicting claims made by communication scholars, deciding which approach you may find most appealing for your research purposes, and, finally, coming up with an appropriate research design to help you with the writing of your thesis in the CCT Program. The class is divided into three sections. A few epistemological debates will be covered in the first part of the class to investigate the rationale behind (the often) conflicting research methodologies and traditions. The second part of the class will be devoted to diverse research methods employed in CCT scholarship including ethnography, post-modern methods, content analysis and survey design. The last part of the course covers positivist methods geared toward \xE2\x80\x9Cthinking\xE2\x80\x9D quantitatively about our research designs. The chief requirement for the class is to develop a research design for your thesis in successive iterations throughout the semester.

    :description: The notion of fame has deep historical roots, but "celebrity" is a relatively recent phenomenon that has emerged through the technological innovations of the last 150 years. This course will examine celebrity as media spectacle, celebrity as a process in which every production waits to be eclipsed by the next production. Drawing from several disciplines, we will attempt to understand American celebrity as a product of the cult of the individual and as an integral feature of advanced capitalism. Case studies will range from the marketing of child star Shirley Temple to the trial of O.J. Simpson.

SF ignites the Industrial Revolution; carries out the Cold War; invents the Internet. In this course, we'll look at SF and the scientist as culture-hero in turn-of-the-century America; the birth of \"fan culture\" in the 1930's; we'll examine how SF informs the American myth of progress and how it permeates the rhetoric of politics and diplomacy following the Second World War. We'll look at the body and SF, from the Ubermensch to the post-human cyborgs we've already become. We'll draw from periodicals like Amazing Stories and Popular Mechanics; non-fiction like Boyer's By the Bomb's Early Light (1985) and Davis' City of Quartz (1992); radio drama like War of the Worlds (1938); novels like Delilo's White Noise (1985) and Stephenson's Snow Crash (1992); a variety of short stories from SF's \"Golden Age\"; television like Star Trek (1966\xE2\x80\x931969) and The Day After (1983); cinema like Forbidden Planet (1956), Alien (1979), Koyaanisqatsi (1983), Blade Runner (1982/92), and Fog of War (2003); theater like that of Survival Research Labs (1978\xE2\x80\x932006); and computer games like Space Invaders and Suspended (1983). We'll make use of theoretical perspectives of Susan Sontag, Vivian Sobchack, Scott Bukatman, Langdon Winner, Darko Suvin, David E. Nye, and others. Using a private web-based wiki, students will regularly contribute brief reflections on SF concepts or themes of their choosing. Students will have the opportunity to write a final research paper or produce a short digital documentary that makes use of SF's richly aural and visual tradition.

    :description: "When comedian Stephen Colbert coined the term \xE2\x80\x9Ctruthiness,\xE2\x80\x9D he touched more than the nation\xE2\x80\x99s funny bone. Embedded within this comic gag is a deep concern over how American citizens use (or misuse) information. \xE2\x80\x9CTruthiness\xE2\x80\x9D pokes fun not only at politicians and public officials who bend facts for self-serving purposes, but also at journalists and commentators who are complicit in abuses of information, citizens who have a responsibility to be skeptical about poor quality information, and even academics who deconstruct information to the nth degree and often obliterate its integrity. \xE2\x80\x9CTruth\xE2\x80\x9D is a human construct that carries human responsibilities. We see snapshots of this in a movie like A Few Good Men, in the oft-parodied exchange when Tom Cruise shouts \xE2\x80\x9CI want the Truth,\xE2\x80\x9D and Jack Nicholson retorts, \xE2\x80\x9CYou can\xE2\x80\x99t handle the truth.\xE2\x80\x9D We can also see ranges of truth by comparing a film like Al Gore\xE2\x80\x99s An Inconvenient Truth, in which the preponderance of evidence about global warming is inescapable, to the recent political allegory Cach\xC3\xA9 (French for \xE2\x80\x9CHidden), in which two adult men clash fatally over a childhood memory and we discover \xE2\x80\x9Ctruth\xE2\x80\x9D is irrelevant compared to the feelings attached to the interpretations. This seminar springs from a simple question: What are the responsibilities of individual citizens acting as gate-keepers in an information-rich civil society? Some examples: Prior to the Vietnam War journalists foretold many of the problems that would and did arise. Why did the United States plunge ahead? The \xE2\x80\x9Cwar on terror\xE2\x80\x9D is rife with confusion and misinformation. Why did America again commit troops overseas? In personal relationships, lovers often ignore obvious clues and their status. Why do we think we see what is not there? Retail spenders often make purchases based on incomplete information. Television commentators scream opinions with little evidence to back up their claims. The government is cutting taxes and increasing deficits while corporations are shedding pension programs and baby boomers are about to retire. What is wrong with this picture? Through readings and viewings, seminar discussions, and a semester paper this class will analyze and theorize about \xE2\x80\x9Cquality of information\xE2\x80\x9D to explore the mutual gate-keeping responsibilities of media producers and citizens who consume information."

    :description: How do texts and readers change with the advent of the printing press, machine-made paper, linotype, and steam-powered presses-as well as with the invention of the woodcut, photography, movies, the e-book, and even the online (interactive) video game? How do texts vary as we move from oral to scribal to print culture--and from the material to the digital text? How has digital culture and technology changed our concepts of the author, the reader, and the interaction between the two? And how is the literary history of particular eras inflected by such cultural influences as law, economics, and technology? Such questions are central to "Technologies of the Text"--that is, the understanding of (literary) texts as both material artifacts and potentially disembodied (electronic) forms. This course offers students an opportunity to explore some of the cultural and historical concepts behind such issues as information technology, electronic communication, internet architecture, textual theory, and the science of knowledge. We will also consider topics such as authorship, forgery, plagiarism, piracy, translation, (re)production, dissemination, library culture, and the history of reading. Many of these issues will provide offer digital and literary analogues. In the digital context, we will discuss theories of hypertext, weblog journals, and online novels. In the literary context, we will discuss the historical foundation underlying several central debates within current literary theory, including the unstable status of the author, the gendered politics of literary publication, the economics of book distribution, the shifting definition of literary textuality, the history of literary censorship, and the legal evolution of copyright in the Digital Age. Theoretical readings will include essays by Benjamin, Borges, Chartier, Darnton, Derrida, Drucker, Eaves, Eisenstein, Foucault, Habermas, Hayles, Jackson, Landow, McGann, Negroponte, Stallybrass, Sutherland, and Woodmansee, among others. In order to bring the foregoing issues into focus, we will read some influential literary works that stand as particular examples and illustrations within the Technologies of the Text. In addition to landmark examples by Chaucer, Defoe, Sterne, Pope, Blake, Wordsworth, Byron, Hemans, Austen, Dickens, and the Brontes, we will also trace some of the more recent and experimental developments within literary textuality and hypertext.

    :description: "What role should public opinion play in a democracy? This oft-debated issue (since Aristotle to Tocqueville to today\xE2\x80\x99s talking heads) is not merely of philosophical import. Rather, beliefs about public opinion\xE2\x80\x99s role in democracy have the potential to shape every facet of political and social life. Throughout this course we will examine competing views about the role of public opinion in democracy. We will explore public opinion and propaganda employed by politicians, government and industry in the United States. We will examine how politicians, government officials, and industry go about the business of public opinion and propaganda. Does public opinion act as an agenda-setting force for politicians and government officials, or is data gathered employed as framing device for communicating the will of the governing to the governed? Thus, is measured public opinion \"the input\" and propaganda \"the output?\" This course will examine several contemporary perspectives on this argument, and will use, among others, Clinton\xE2\x80\x99s failed universal health care initiative and Bush\xE2\x80\x99s war on terror as case studies. Finally, we will discuss public opinion polling specifically as it pertains to elections. We will look at media reporting of \"the race for elected office,\" and consider the impact of reporting public opinion on voter behavior. For example, does media reporting of public opinion actually shape future public opinion? If so, how? How do exit polls impact those who have not yet voted? For this last portion of the class we will spend considerable time examining the controversy surrounding the 2000 national election and the now-defunct Voter News Service (VNS). Students taking this course will be expected to be thoroughly engaged in \"poll watching\" throughout the semester. As such, each week students must turn in a short (no more than one page) typed brief on a specific poll, and consider the implications of its release. In addition to the brief, class participation and a final research paper round out the criteria for grading."

    :description: "This course begins with a consideration of what makes you comfortable and willing to communicate with others in physical space and online in a synchronous communication program. Then we ask: what makes you willing to shop or pay for a transaction in physical space and online? What can we learn about online interaction from experience in physical space? When would your communication and comfort online translate into your willingness to make a financial transaction? What would you pay to participate in a game or instant messaging program or how much advertising would you be willing to view as part of your experience? Moreover, we ask what would make a target group of participant-consumers comfortable interacting online and willing to pay for their interaction. In the course, we analyze online, synchronous communication programs used for:\xC2\xAA socializing\xC2\xAA education \xC2\xAA business, and\xC2\xAA gameplaying Assignments include the analysis of synchronous communication situations in physical space and online; a critique of participation in online programs that are free or that involve a flat fee or subscription payment; the creation of a market research survey to query a target audience for an online communication program; and a proposal for a new synchronous communication program, a specific event to be held within an existing environment, or improvements to an existing communication program. The course provides a selected survey of programs including university courseware, a matchmaking Web site, a real-time customer service component of an online business and possibly WebEx, a game program such as a collaborative puzzle, and possible other programs including instant messaging, video-conferencing and telephony connections. Synchronous communication programs are examined as:\xC2\xAA interfaces\xC2\xAA performative and imaginative events \xC2\xAA social and cultural sites\xC2\xAA learning spaces, and \xC2\xAA business opportunitiesOverall, the course considers how social, cultural and business issues influence design considerations. Some questions the course will pose include:\xC2\xAA How does social interaction merge with a purchase transaction in online communication programs? How much are people willing to invest in time and money to communicate with others online? \xC2\xAA How does the quality of a program affect its profitability? \xC2\xAA How does the tension between a settled interface design and customizable options for viewing and interaction express itself in a particular program? \xC2\xAA What is desirable and what is extraneous in online communications? \xC2\xAA How do communication, navigation and representation options relate to establishing trust, security and privacy online? \xC2\xAA How do you provide people with a sense of agency when interacting online? \xC2\xAA How can rules, member profiles, and community events be designed to enhance a person's interest in participating in an online environment? \xC2\xAA What theories of interface and agency best explain people's interactions in the program you study?

The course is designed to expose students both to the theoretical considerations involved in crafting surveys and research projects, as well as to the practical choices and challenges involved in real-world online and offline survey research. The theoretical components of the course will focus on a range of multi-mode (i.e., web, email, postal mail, telephone) survey research topics, including: project conceptualization; research design; sampling considerations; execution; response handling; analysis; and reporting results. The practical component of the course involves students acting as project managers/lead researchers who are responsible for envisioning, executing, analyzing, and reporting the results of a survey project on behalf of an external client (e.g., The Smithsonian). The clients for the projects will be identified by or with the approval of the instructor. Students will be evaluated on their application of the theoretical concepts to the successful completion of each stage of the survey research process. Readings: Groves, R. Fowler, F., Couper, M. Lepkowski, J, Singer, E. and Tourangeau, R. (2004) Survey Methodology, NY: Wiley. And other selected readings."

    :number: "688"
    :description: Censured by Plato, condemned by the Church, and marginalized by the Industrial Revolution, play has long been consigned to the peripheries of Western culture as the fatuous pastime of children and the simpleminded. Now, the recent return of serious interest in play and the ludic is made more compelling by the rapid emergence of playful new media like video games and hyperfiction. This course will focus on new media as we survey a challenging variety of disciplinary perspectives on play, borrowing from rhetoric, aesthetics, cultural anthropology, Continental philosophy, critical theory, political science, computer science, developmental psychology, and biology. We will consider how these frameworks thicken our understanding of hyperfiction and video games, and how these new media require that we rethink conventional models of play in culture. Building ethnographies of the real world and the virtual, we will examine the liminality of game-space, and discuss the communitas of games and play. We will look at machinima in order to consider how each stage in the life of new media (production, distribution, consumption) is potentially a site of play. We will examine how politicians and policy-makers are framing discourse about games and gamers. And we will explore the ethics of play as we look at how interactive environments are being used by marketing and military industries. This course offers a historical context and critical vocabulary for thinking about ludic textuality and new media. Students will work collaboratively to present assigned readings in class, and will work independently on a final research project. At least one class session will be conducted within an online virtual space. Throughout the semester, students will be encouraged to think about interdisciplinarity as a kind of ludic activity. Readings include selections from Aarseth, Barthes, Caillois, Dyer-Witheford, Geertz, Huizinga, Jenkins, Landow, Moulthrop, Nietzsche, Plato, Rorty, Spariosu, Sutton-Smith, Taylor, Turner, and Zimmerman. We will also look at play and games in Borges, Cage, Coover, Derrida, Homer, Nabokov, and Pavic. We will make use of interactive environments and games like Second Life and World of Warcraft, as well as early interactive fictions from Infocom.

  - :name: Theories of Culture and Interdisciplinarity
    :number: "689"
    :description: Using the discourses and study of culture as a theme, the course will examine some of its major theorizations in the Anglo-American and European traditions. In both the humanities and the social sciences, "culture" has been defined in multiple ways--"high," "low," "popular," "mass," "everyday"-- and territorialized by many disciplines-- literature, history, anthropology, sociology, political science, and most prominently by cultural studies. Therefore, we will look at the methodologies and disciplinary imperatives of knowledge production from the standpoints of different fields and sites (the university, the museum, etc.). We do foreground, however, an anthropological approach that focuses on the problems of "making meaning" and how this process is represented in various structured narrative forms or genres such as novel, ethnography, film, travelogue, critical essay, or interview. In short, we are concerned with the interpretation of culture in its manifest forms. We will read not only primary theoretical texts, such as Adorno, Benjamin, Geertz, Said, Foucault, Baudrillard, but also those that deal with the problematic representation of cultures, usually as "foreign," or "other," such as Levi-Strauss' classic Tristes Tropiques or a Fassbinder film about Turkish guestworkers in Germany. Short papers, group class presentations, active class participation, and a final project are required.

In this course, students will use popular culture as a site from which to analyze the story American culture told/tells through popular culture forms. Students will analytically read popular cultural forms and tell stories digitally about those readings. While we will read scholarly works of history, theory and cultural criticism, substantial amounts of time will be spent working together to develop analyses of popular culture \xE2\x80\x9Cstuff.\xE2\x80\x9D Students will then undertake their own analysis of an object of popular culture and tell a story about that analysis using new media.

Although the course will center on the development of historically-informed analyses, we will consider a variety of theoretically-informed perspectives (for instance, textual analysis, audience analysis or theories of the carnivalesque). We will undertake these analyses collectively, ranging widely across a great diversity of American popular culture artifacts since World War II (such as, film, cartoons, dancing, television and music). Questions this course will address include: What meaning does popular culture communicate? What theoretical perspectives can aid in understanding that meaning? How has American popular culture changed over the last half-century? How has the development of new technologies opened new avenues of popular culture and foreclosed old ones?

    :description: This course is intended to expose students to issues regarding the social, economic and ethical implications of networked devices on society, both now and in the future. Various industries have become increasingly aware of the impacts with the amplified use of computer technology on daily life. While technology promises many advantages to our society and economy, the full range of their ramifications must be considered. Network devices serve not only as a channel for information, but also as a conduit to disseminate information. Therefore, they can and have benefited not only corporations, but also the individual. This course will introduce students to the major issues surrounding omnipresent access to information within our society, and to aid students in understanding the development, application, and consequences of network devices as social and technical processes. Topics to be explored include personal privacy and freedom of information, the manageability, risks and accountability of complex systems, and the goals and issues of corporations while considering professional ethics and professional responsibility. Discussions, readings, presentations and a course project are components of this course.

    :description: "Note: CCTP 702-01 does not fulfill the core theory requirement. Only CCTP-02 fulfills the requirement. A different final project will be required for section 02 students. Please register accordingly. From the propaganda films of Nazi Germany to present day advertising, communication campaigns have attempted to change the behavior of targeted individuals and groups. While theories of communication 'silver bullets' have been discredited, many individuals, groups, and governments continue to affect behavior through licit and illicit means. Communication Campaigns presents theories of behavior change and the potential role for theory-based communication campaigns in facilitating behavior change in specific populations. The course will cover basic theories of behavior change and their applicability to campaign design. Aspects covered will include political communication, health communication, propaganda, economic development campaigns, diffusion of ideas, the design and evaluation of communication campaigns, and the ethical implications of these behaviors. By the end of the course students will know major examples of communication campaigns, demonstrate the skills to design communication campaigns, and assess the effectiveness of campaigns using statistical analysis. The course has three objectives: 1. Understand the major alternative theories that explain variation in behavior among individuals and larger social units. Address the implications of those theories for the potential role of communication campaigns in influencing change in behavior. 2. Know major examples of the historical experience of communication programs in the United States and elsewhere. Assess the credibility of the evidence for their effectiveness. 3. Master the logic of and gain skills in (a) using theory to guide data collection at the design stage of a program, and (b) using the data to design a theory based communication strategy."

    :description: "Note: the following course description is for a previous version of this class, and the course description for Fall 2005 will change slightly. As part of the broader debate on (post)modernity, this course will explore the topic of globalization and its influence on the construction of cultural identities at a moment where relations of time, space, and place are changing rapidly. In short, I want to focus on the movement and mobility of peoples, ideas, and information. We will begin by addressing the contested term globalization itself, its association with other notions, such as internationalization, Americanization, or Westernization, and its controversial linkage with consumerism and homogenization. We will both theorize central key concepts associated with place, such as \"home,\" \"diaspora,\" \"exile,\" \"border,\" as well as the inhabitants (nationalized, ethnicized, gendered, mechanized, etc.) of such places. This analysis will be done in the context of vacillating definitions of universalities, such as the \"globe\" \"the empire,\" or the \"nation-state\" and particularities, such as regions, cities, families, and other collectivities. I want us to apply new understanding gained from this analysis to what Jameson and Miyoshi call \"alternative localities\" around the globe. Readings from Appadurai, Bauman, Negri/Hardt, Sassen, Jameson, Poster, Haraway and others. Short papers, group class presentations, active class participation, and a final project are required."

    :description: "Why does it seem journalism is so tame during such wild times? During the 1980s, changes in anti-trust enforcement and broadcast regulation revolutionized the television and journalism industries giving us the media models we have today. Until then, broadcast journalism and broadcast television enjoyed a symbiotic relationship in which one enabled the success of the other. This seminar will explore the interplay between these two important cultural voices across six decades of history. Topics related to television history will include the origin of television technology; the rise of networks and diffusion of television sets; key regulatory milestones and their influences on programming; cultural, news, and technological breakthroughs in the Kennedy years; the rise of independent producers and 1970s \xE2\x80\x9Cquality television\xE2\x80\x9D; and decade-by-decade patterns of entertainment programming related to race, gender, working, politics, and popular culture. Topics dealing with journalism history will address the origins of radio journalism; WWII developments in broadcast journalism, including technology, practices, and prestige; early TV news; the effect of the Quiz Show Scandal on news; The Great Debates, live press conferences and the rise of TV news and documentaries in the 1960s; fallout from the 1968 Democratic National Convention; Vietnam and the media; network competition and regulation in the 1970s; deregulation in the 1980s; media consolidation; and 9/11, the \xE2\x80\x9Cwar on terror,\xE2\x80\x9D and negative influences on levels of public discourse related to diminution of broadcast journalism. This course should interest students in the Media and Politics, Cultural Studies, and Media, Art & Representation clusters.

We will touch on key documentary forms, including photojournalism and radio, from the 1930s and the Roosevelt era. Most of the course, however, will address history and documentaries since WWII, which may include, for example, the Cold War, Civil Rights, the Kennedy years, Vietnam, 1968, social movements of the 1970s, the Reagan years, the Clinton impeachment, the first term of Bush II, and 9/11. We\xE2\x80\x99ll read some of the fundamental works of documentary history and criticism, as well as various examples of documentary theory.

    :description: The main theme of this course is the way international negotiations become increasingly important as globalization thickens and deepens, especially with respect to information technologies. Globalization refers to the patterns of increased interdependence in economic, security and cultural matters. Thickening here refers to the number of issue-areas brought into globalization, whereas deepening refers to its intensity. International negotiations are shaping both the scope and the depth of global interactions. This course prepares you to understand globalization from the vantage point of international negotiations. How and why do negotiations take place? What factors determine their outcomes? How do negotiators tackle conflicting claims from domestic constituencies or from their opponents? This class uses extensively the case study method of teaching. This allows the class to focus in-depth on the practice of negotiations. Conceptual development will be supplemented by class participation and discussion around several case studies of international negotiations. Class assignments are oriented toward the "real world" of negotiators and there will be several instances where class participants will be asked to role play in case studies of negotiations. The course is divided into two parts. The first part of the course will begin with the major issues involved in international negotiations (actors, issues, strategies, power in bargaining) and then add in complications arising from market conditions, domestic institutions and multilateral negotiations. The second part will discuss specific diplomatic disputes and negotiations in international communications.

    :description: "What is postmodernism? Is it a historical moment that emerges from modernity? Is it a different notion of history itself from that of modernist intellectual work? Is it a set of texts and objects, or a significant change in the ways we discuss such things? Does postmodernism describe a renewed critique of the political economy of capitalism, and its related cultural production? This course is an examination of the meanings of the postmodern in its various approaches. The course emerges from the practices of critical theory and cultural studies, and asks questions about who are the subjects of postmodernism's discourses: for whom is the postmodern a theory of what has happened in the moment of late capitalism? How do theories of the postmodern define the social practices of power and language which define (but do not entirely delimit) us in this historical moment? Do contemporary media reflect the shifts in zeitgeist that critics of the postmodern claim, or perhaps do we simply live in the full realization of modernism's projects? The course begins with questions of what defines modernism, as it emerges in 19th century European philosophy, politics and aesthetics, and then becomes the full-scaled critical and artistic blossoming of the industrial west in the 20th century. The syllabus then moves to those projects that attempt to historicize postmodernism in distinction to modernism, whereupon we take up critical projects which have emerged more recently in relation to current global political events and the phenomenon of globalization itself."

    :number: "738"
    :description: This seminar is for students interested in learning about contemporary visual art in our current historical moment. The visual arts have always been about contexts, and the arts are always being repositioned according to ongoing institutional debates, internal artworld competition, artistic rivalries, uses and inclusions of new technologies, and shifting priorities in artistic media. We will work toward developing a big picture of the contemporary artworld by looking at exciting work being produced today in the context of recent art history, the artistic and social contexts of contemporary art in the museum and gallery system, and the business and economics of the art industry. We'll find that what counts as art has always been the product of an artworld. An artworld exists to produce and safeguard the category of art in our culture, as well as to reproduce itself in ongoing configurations and redistributions of power, authority, and prestige. The one constant in contemporary art--art as institutionally recognized since the 1950s--is the continuity of an artworld in the construction of art works as such. The seminar will be developed in real time with the participation of seminar members (see the course hypersyllabus, always evolving with student participation). We will base as much of our discussions and analysis on works and exhibitions that we can see during the semester. The entire lived and active world of contemporary art is our domain, including the legacy of the past and inclusion of new media. Prior knowledge of modern and contemporary art is helpful, but not required. Enthusiasm for learning, intellectual curiosity, and susceptibility to acts of extreme beauty and provocation are more important for this seminar than any prior academic background. We will take several "field trips" to galleries and museums in Washington and also a longer trip to New York. Weekly assignments will include readings in art history and art theory, viewing specific works in area museums and galleries, and group collaborative seminar presentations. Grades will be based on seminar presentations and a final research project.

Murnau 1927) The Jazz Singer (Alan Crosland 1927) We will consider the importance of various factors on silent film production including audience demographics, picture palaces, technological developments and the Hollywood production system. We will explore the contours of what it meant to be a \xE2\x80\x9Cstar\xE2\x80\x9D (Louise Brooks and Rudolph Valentino will be our case studies) and what it meant to look and to be looked at. We will examine the cultural and political ramifications of different silent film genres such as the documentary, the western, comedy and melodrama. We will explore how cinema created and responded to cultural myths \xE2\x80\x93 in particular, myths of America, of race and of gender. We will closely analyze components of the films from shots and POV to editing and score. Each film will be accompanied by readings that further elucidate the film, its director, or its genre and by primary source readings that address issues contemporary to the film. For example, when we watch a western, we will also read Theodore Roosevelt\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CThe Strenuous Life.\xE2\x80\x9D In addition to class participation, requirements for this seminar include weekly written responses and the preparation of a final conference paper, which will include an abstract, an oral presentation and a final written paper."

    :description: "As human environments become dominated by technology, we are increasingly at risk of technology dictating our needs as opposed to meeting them. The ultimate design of a product, system, or solution is often grounded much more on the technology that it is built than the needs, desires, and attributes of the users for whom it is intended. This course will review and apply human-centered user research techniques for delivering web-based solutions to the Coalition for Community Schools and the Smithsonian Education Organization. The human-centered design research deliverables will be used by the customers and CCT students to redesign the online user experience in a subsequent course offering (Human-Centered Design: User Interface Design)."

    :number: "753"
    :description: "Over the past few years, the benefits of the networked economy have been given tremendous play be investors, journalists, business school pundits, and government officials alike How little we truly understand the workings of the Networked Economy was recently made clear, however, by the mad rush to invest in Internet stocks and the subsequent \"correction\" of the market. Explanations of this sequence of events have been anything but profound. As described by Thomas E. Weber, for the Wall Street Journal, \"The Internet bubble may have burst, but don't worry.\" From the people who brought us, \"Profits don't matter!\" There is already a new mind-bending mantra: Failure is good. It's that kind of doublethink that convinced a whole lot of people over the last two years that anything Internet-related was a sure thing. The recent setbacks do not belie the fact that we are entering into a new economic era, supported and mediated by advanced networking technologies. To the contrary, all economic indicators suggest that the unprecedented recent growth in the economy can be attributed to advances in and more widespread diffusion of networking technologies. What these setbacks do indicate, however, is that the forces driving the networked economy are far more complex than was previously understood. The class will provide some theoretical underpinnings for understanding the networked economy, and the technological, economic, and social issues to which it will likely give rise. The aim is for students to be able to better analyze and explain events and developments associated with the networked economy."

    :description: "Politics is intimately related to persuasion and manipulation. Thus, the mastery of language is highly integrated with political life. The quantity and variety of spoken and written political texts, the wealth of genres and rhetorical styles, and the intensity of the political word offer rich arenas for the study of language. We will approach this task from both communication and linguistic perspectives while examining campaign communication, political speeches, advertising, debates, and media coverage. The linguistic focus will highlight discursive practices of argumentation and persuasion, as well as the use of metaphor, framing, and politeness. We will also consider the changing landscape of global political language after September 11. Different approaches to the language of politics \xE2\x80\x93 from communication theories to cognitive and pragmatic methods \xE2\x80\x93 will help us shed light on the Aristotelian claim that we are all political animals, able to use language to pursue our own ends.

This course addresses the reality behind the First Amendment in contrast with its popular conception. This course will explore the transitional First Amendment concepts and analyze how they apply in modern day contexts. Can a teenager research AIDS on the Internet in a public library? Can your cable company stop you from using its Internet access service to reach a particular web site? Can a DJ get fired for speaking out against interracial marriage? How about if the DJ swears while doing it? How does the First Amendment affect artistic expression in performing as well as visual arts? Do politicians get favored or disfavored treatment in the media? How do other western democracies treat the freedom of speech without the First Amendment? What theoretical approaches underlie different understandings of the First Amendment? Should the different aspects of technology affect First Amendment rights, and does it? In addition to looking at the state of the law and how it is perceived, the class will look at the real-world ways in which the government and private entities determine and influence how speech is affected."

The similarities and differences of specific cases will be used to foster a discussion about the wider issue of how the media treats the representation of minorities, and, conversely, how media is used by its producers to reinforce, negotiate, or challenge a group identity. Is the Web an equalizer? Student activity and research will be highlighted, and seminar direction will be determined in part by student research interest; setting up a framework for ongoing research and conference presentation will be emphasized.

    :description: This course will examine the making of national policy toward network industries, including communications industries (telephone, broadcasting, and cable) as well as the Internet and the computer industry. We'll start with a description of the major national policymaking institutions, including Congress, the Justice Department, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, and the Commerce Department. We will discuss the major interest groups (businesses, associations, public interest advocates) whose formal and informal interaction with the policymaking institutions results in the laws, regulations, court orders and policy statements that are the outputs of the policymaking process. We will examine the role of think tanks and the media in the policymaking process. We'll look at how this process works in practice through the detailed examination of several cases where the government established competition policy and intellectual property rules for network industries. We will assess the arguments for and against the policies in question and analyze the strategies and methods used by interested parties to advance their cause. At the end of the course, you should know enough about the process and politics of policymaking in this area so that you can "find your way around" other policy issues affecting network industries.

    :description: "The appearance of new kinds of representational codes that are shaped by digital media indicates that the world of visual and acoustic culture increasingly is shifting from the tenets of realism to those of the virtual. While there is an emerging body of scholarly work that addresses the kinds of communities and discourses associated with virtuality, it remains a pressing task to theorize how virtuality serves as a metaphor for various ethnoscapes, mediations and forms of \xE2\x80\x9Cdisorganized capital\xE2\x80\x9D (to use Arjun Appadurai\xE2\x80\x99s terms) operating in the present moment. Thus, it becomes necessary to ask: What is the \xE2\x80\x9Cvirtual\xE2\x80\x9D? What is its relation to the domain of political economy, to the practices of everyday life, to other modes of representation, to pre-existing notions about identity, race, gender, sexuality and location? We will address these questions in this course in terms of a variety of critical/theoretical writings that have examined virtuality as a new way of depicting \xE2\x80\x9Creal life\xE2\x80\x9D through the virtual\xE2\x80\x99s mimicry of sensation of physical space, of time, of value, of corporeality, of performance, and of speech and gesture."

    :description: While the notion of propaganda actually began with the proclamation of the Roman Catholic faith, or Propagandum Fide, during the Reformation/Catholic Reformation struggles of the 15th century, the current notion stems from the 1920s and 1930s with the use of the mass media to inform, form, and deform public opinion and attitude. Attempts to alter public opinion can be traced through the work of Riefenstahl, various architects of agitprop and national socialism and instances of genocide in the USSR, Rwanda, Cambodia, and China. The theory of propaganda and the mass audience evidences itself in the works of Lippmann, Lasswell, Speier, Ellul, and others. This course will cover key works in the history and theory of propaganda and will attempt to address some of the societal, policy, and moral dimensions of propaganda and its effect on persons and communities, including its common end in war and military actions.

  - :name: Media and Political Engagement
    :number: "805"
    :description: "The media are a dominant presence in the political sphere. Yet, there is tremendous disagreement among scholars and practitioners about the nature and effects of media on political engagement. This course will examine the wide range of perspectives on media and political engagement focusing primarily, but not exclusively, on the United States. Communication is essential for developing norms of cooperation in society. A vital public sphere consisting of places where citizens come together to discuss core values, issues, and events is an essential component of civil society. Public debate allows citizens to communicate with government officials and institutions, and to engage in problem solving. The media help citizens establish community networks by generating awareness of issues and promoting voluntary activities. By providing information in a timely and accessible form, the media enable people to make well-informed choices, thus building support for democratic governance. Not everyone agrees that the mass media promote civic engagement. Some scholars, notably Robert Putnam, argue that civil society in the United States has been eroding since the 1960s when television became a fixture in American homes. As people spend more of their time watching television alone, they become less committed to community-based or group activities, such as attending town meetings and working for political parties. As a result, public support for the political system has eroded, voter participation has declined, and political apathy has become widespread. Other scholars take issue with the perspective that mass media are detrimental for civil society. They point to evidence that community activism is thriving in media-saturated environments. Studies indicate that societies that have widespread access to mass media also have well-developed social and volunteer networks, and are high in social capital and political trust. As a result, people are likely to become involved with particular causes that interest them. For example, almost 70 percent of high school students and young adults claim they have been involved in voluntary community service activities. The significance of the media\xE2\x80\x99s content in promoting or inhibiting the development of a strong culture of political engagement is another subject of debate. On the one hand, the mass media offer ample news and public affairs content which promotes political knowledge and can empower citizens to take action. On the other hand, news coverage often focuses on the negative aspects of politics, such as scandal and corruption, which can alienate citizens and keep them from becoming involved. In addition, many people primarily attend to entertainment programming which emphasizes values that are antithetical to ideals that support community involvement. Situation comedies, dramas, and reality programs, the most popular shows on television, concentrate on characters and stories that emphasize individualism. Story lines often show people acting alone to solve problems and overcome adversity and rarely depict associations or groups working to better society. The emergence of the Internet as a formidable technology of mass communication provides an opportunity to contemplate the future of civil society and political engagement. Proponents argue that the Internet improves democratic representation by enhancing people\xE2\x80\x99s ability to engage in civic life. Online discussion boards, chat rooms, and web logs or blogs allow ordinary people unprecedented access to the public sphere. Political leaders and the mainstream media have become attentive to the writings of \xE2\x80\x9Ccitizen journalists,\xE2\x80\x9D who can provide insights into public opinion on issues and act as watchdogs monitoring government actions. Online media also can strengthen associations by allowing people with similar concerns to come together in virtual communities even if they live far apart. Relationships that form online can translate into participation offline, as virtual community members arrange to meet face-to-face. Online communication helps simplify the organizational aspects of community groups, as members can readily share logistical information, such as how to carry out particular tasks. Skeptics admit that the interactive communication facilitated by the Internet may be better than sitting passively in front of the television, but the connections between citizens and associations fostered online only go so far. The online environment does not automatically create generous citizens who give of their time to help others. Virtual communities cannot do the hands-on volunteer work that is needed to care for the poor and elderly, raise children, and staff community programs. Further, the digital divide which separates those who have access to the technology and the skills t use it from those who do not threatens to exclude much of society from engaging online. Thus, community activism will be limited to those who already have the greatest resources in a society."

    :number: "807"
    :description: Innovative breakthroughs, or even incremental improvements in products, are increasingly viewed as the key to business success. As product development becomes ever more complex in terms of features and functionality, it becomes crucial that those involved in the design of these products consider the needs and limitations of those who will be using them. Moreover, users are more sophisticated with respect to their expectations about product performance. Consequently, good product design and usability testing are seen as part of industry's responsibility to its customers, and it is also important for maintaining a competitive edge (profitability) in the marketplace. This course will focus on both the theory and practice underlying the/ product development/ process. While this course sequentially follows product planning (CCT 806), it is not a pre-requisite to enroll. If taken together, CCT 806 and 807 will take you through the entire product development lifecycle from the initial product planning to product design and development.

  - :name: Technology, Culture & Development
    :number: "813"
    :description: "This course examines how culture and institutions affect the political economy of technology and development. Culture refers to collectively held attitudes, values, and beliefs. Institutions are patterns of behavior, rules, and organizations that shape human conduct and interaction. The Nobel Prize winning economist Douglass North writes: \xE2\x80\x9CIt is culture that provides the key to path dependence -- a term used to describe the powerful influence of the past on the present and future.\xE2\x80\x9D The main theme of the course is to examine the embeddedness of political economy institutions and property rights in culture. In doing so, institutional partnerships (business, governments, NGOs, international organizations) are emphasized. Part I of the course provides a historical look, mainly at Europe, toward understanding the cultural and institutional factors that facilitated or hindered the industrial revolution. We will also examine the implications and lessons to be drawn from applying such factors to the developing world. Part II of the course will examine the cultural and institutional aspects of the field of development communication for poor countries in post-colonial times. Part III of the course examines development project implementation in the context of culture. Issues such as mass media marketing campaigns, microfinance, electronic commerce, and telecommunications restructurings will be covered. Students will be asked to participate in actual development projects underway in Latin America, Asia and Africa through partnerships that CCT/Georgetown has developed. There will be two other themes developed in the class. One will deal with the notion of cultural hybriditites -- the intersection of micro level cultures with national and global ones -- and the way that these influence development efforts. The other theme will explore how to translate abstract conceptions of culture and development into creative and common sense-oriented development options. While culture and development issues become increasingly important, such thinking is still in its infancy. The collection of works examining the effects of culture on development with respect to technology is even more limited. In order to be thorough in our investigation, however, we will read works which both directly and indirectly touch upon cultural issues in the development process even if they do not address institutional issues at length. We will also read works which deal with institutions and development and then investigate if they would gain from an insight into cultural issues. As would befit a transdisciplinary class, the readings are drawn from the works of economists, political scientists, sociologists, anthropologists, communication scholars, educationists, psychologists, international relations, and development practitioners. I have made a concerted effort also to draw upon works by scholars from the developing worlds in Asia, Latin America and Africa."

    :description: The goal of this course is to provide you with the essential skills and knowledge to be an intelligent consumer and practitioner of research. On the one hand, today's high tech culture and economy requires that you can consume research; that is, have the ability to analyze empirical data and thoughtfully appraise the analyses of others. Research is an integral part of everyday problem-solving and decision-making. Additionally, this graduate program is going to ask you to engage in the research process. To understand and participate in the growth of a science, no matter how modestly, you must have a working knowledge of methods and procedures. When done properly research is exciting, creative, fun and personally and scientifically rewarding. To this end, our course will introduce you to a wide array of research tools (surveys, experiments, content analysis and field research) available to social scientists.

    :description: "The acceleration in the creation and dissemination of technology in the last five decades, combined with the information revolution, has a major impact on the growth prospects of advanced and developing countries. These revolutions in information and technology are also increasing trade integration and other interdependences across countries and regions. The course starts with a brief overview of the role of technology in growth and development, as well as the basics of invention, innovation, and commercialization of technology. It explores the interplay between four critical elements of a country's readiness to take advantage of these revolutions: a demanding economic incentive and institutional regime; an educated and skilled population; a dynamic information infrastructure; and an effective innovation system. It uses measures of these elements to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the US, the main European countries, Japan, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, and major developing regions. It also explores how the technology and information revolutions affect four key issues of global concern: inequality, security, sustainability, and quality of life. With these building blocks and some basic assumptions about key political and economic trends, students will be asked to project how the world may look in 2020, and to propose actions to improve these prospective futures. The course is open to upperclassmen and graduate students with some background in economics and international relations."

In particular, we look at specific economic, legal and political factors that form the basis for institutional differences between developing and developed nations and play a critical role in shaping the business environment in these economies. This course is designed with two broad objectives: 1. To understand how institutional differences between developing countries and developed countries affect industrial development and government policy towards business. 2. To learn empirical tools with which to analyze such differences. For this reason, I will expect students to not only focus on understanding the relevance of the specific cases that are studied in the papers listed in the syllabus but also to be able to discuss and critique the empirical strategies employed in these papers."

    :description: "This course introduces students to the linguist\xE2\x80\x99s view of English and other languages spoken in the United States which have shaped individual and group identities and have impacted the cultural, educational, and political fabric of the nation. We begin with an exploration of the history and distinctiveness of American English, including the language histories of the principal ethnic and racialized groups in the U.S., specifically African American English and Chicano English. We proceed by exploring other languages spoken in this country including Spanish, American Sign Language, Asian American and Native American languages and how these are implicated in questions of education, bilingualism, acquisition, and the English Only Movement. Important themes will include the implications of linguistic discrimination for the survival of minority languages and cultures, the educational success of children, equity in the workplace, and inter-racial/ethnic conflict. Objectives: \xE2\x80\xA2 To familiarize students with the linguists\xE2\x80\x99 way of understanding language. \xE2\x80\xA2 To draw awareness and attention to the ways in which language involved in everyday experience. \xE2\x80\xA2 To explore how language shapes individual and group identities and impacts culture, education, and politics. Goals: To have a highly interactive and participatory environment, an environment based on respect for each other\xE2\x80\x99s ideas and each other\xE2\x80\x99s experiences. One of our most basic presuppositions as linguists is that no language variety is superior to any other, and the first extension of this in our classroom is that no one person\xE2\x80\x99s experiences or perspectives are to be privileged in our discussions. Each of us has something to contribute regarding our experiences with language in this country whether or not we are native to the United States (perhaps even more from an outsider\xE2\x80\x99s perspective). Evaluation: 15% Assignments (3) 10% Journal Entries (2) 15% Discussion Leader 20% Midterm Exam (take home) 10% Mini-ethnography 20% Final Project /Presentation 10% Attendance / Participation Attendance is Required! You WILL NOT Receive full credit for the Attendance portion of your grade if you have more than two absences. Assignments, Journals, Exams are due at the beginning of the class the day that they are assigned. LATE WORK WILL NOT RECEIVE FULL CREDIT If you are going to be absent, you need to make arrangements to have your work in before class time. Blackboard: We will be using the class Blackboard site for assignments, communication, announcements, etc. Blackboard: https://campus.georgetown.edu/webapps/portal/frameset.jsp Description of Assignments: Assignments will be activity - oriented and are designed to teach you to collect and analyze linguistic data. Assignments will be posted on Blackboard the week before they are due. You must turn in a paper copy of your homeworks to me at the beginning of class the day they are due, but I would also like you to post a copy to the Digital Dropbox in the Blackboard course site so that your classmates can see the work that you are doing. Description of the Journal: The journal is meant to help your organize and synthesize your thoughts from readings and discussions as the semester progresses. Your entries should reflect an integration of ideas and perspectives of your classmates, a discussion of how topics raised connect to issues and ideas previously discussed, and an application of what you have learned to your own experiences, to current issues or historical events. THESE SHOULD NOT SIMPLY BE A SUMMARY OF READINGS OR DISCUSSIONS. Each journal entry should be approximately 3 pages long (typed, double-spaced) and should show to me that you are actively thinking of ways in which the sections of the course interact with one another. You may draw from your background, your own experiences, your studies, work, observations, conversations that you have had, things that your encounter in the news. As you begin to identify a final project idea you may use the journal to discuss issues surrounding that process. You should also feel free to include questions or problems that you are having with the material, lingering concerns or difficulties. I will be looking at these holistically and evaluating them based on the development of your thinking over the course of the semester. Presentation / Participation: This course is highly interactive and discussion-centered. You must come to class prepared to discuss the readings and we will be developing skills of both leading and participating in discussions. Discussion Leaders To facilitate this transition, and to prepare you for your final presentations, you will each be assigned to be a Discussion Leader for a specific class. You will be expected to lead the class for approximately 10 minutes on the given topic, sharing an application of the readings or an activity (drawing from your personal experiences, from an article in the news or an academic article) and then eliciting discussion from your classmates. For each day there will be approximately 4 discussion leaders, and although you do not have to work together, I highly encourage you to do so for the sake of developing your ideas and for making the discussions as engaging and stimulating as they can be. Final Presentations The last few class meetings you will be presenting to the class the results of your final project. For all presentations, I encourage you to be creative and to use any media that you find useful to draw from. Please let me know in advance of any AV requirements you may have. Midterm Exam: Will be take-home and short essay. There is no final exam. THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP EXAM - PLESE HAND IN EXAM THE DAY THAT IT IS DUE. Final Project: May be done as an individual or as a group project. If you do hand in a paper, the length of the final write-up should be roughly 10 pages per person (double spaced, 12pt font) However, the project need not be a paper. It can be a website or a film, it can be a portfolio, or a workshop, or even a play (etc.). I encourage you to draw from your personal skills and interests and to be creative. Georgetown has an excellent media facility in the library that can provide you with cameras, software, and training if you start early enough! For a list of what Gelardin has available: http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/gelardin/ Please let me know in advance how you are planning to undertake this project. Honor System: You are all familiar with the honor system here at Georgetown University. Violations of the honor system may include any of the following: cheating on exams and other assignments, committing plagiarism, using false citations, submitting work for multiple purposes, submitting false data, falsifying academic documentation, abuse of library privileges, and abuse of shared electronic media."

    :description: "Politics is intimately related to persuasion and manipulation. Thus, the mastery of language is highly integrated with political life. The quantity and variety of spoken and written political texts, the wealth of genres and rhetorical styles, and the intensity of the political word offer rich arenas for the study of language. We will approach this task from both communication and linguistic perspectives while examining campaign communication, political speeches, advertising, debates, and media coverage. The linguistic focus will highlight discursive practices of argumentation and persuasion, as well as the use of metaphor, framing, and politeness. We will also consider the changing landscape of global political language after September 11. Different approaches to the language of politics \xE2\x80\x93 from communication theories to cognitive and pragmatic methods \xE2\x80\x93 will help us shed light on the Aristotelian claim that we are all political animals, able to use language to pursue our own ends.

The current information age is characterized in terms of the conjunction of fast, cheap telecommunications with cheap and expanding computer power, so that the Internet makes it possible to share and manipulate data - and build transnational communities of interest - with no regard for distance. Trends in the growth and availability of information technology are aligned with trends in the nature of international relations. The course also explores the impact of information technology on both the stakes of international competition and conflict, and the means by which such conflicts are conducted. There is a special focus on such topics as the trade-offs between governmental effectiveness and individual autonomy and privacy; the extent to corporate access to data represents a new challenge to privacy; the changes in the ways that wealth and power interact with each other on the world stage; and how the nature of state sovereignty has evolved. The course also examines diplomatic policy issues raised by the growth of the global information infrastructure, the information services it provides, and the business it empowers. The course is non-technical, althoug the instructors provide a layman's view and (condensed) history of information technology.

    :description: "How does English literature change as we move from oral to scribal to print culture--annd from the material to the digital text? How did the serialization of Victorian novels in periodicals affect their composition, distribution, and readership? And how is the literary history of particular eras inflected by such cultural influences as law, economics, and technology? Such questions are central to \"The History of the Book\"\xE2\x80\x94that is, the understanding of literary texts as both material artifacts and potentially disembodied (electronic) forms. This course offers students of literature an opportunity to explore some of the cultural and historical concepts behind such issues as literary authorship, forgery, piracy, translation, production, dissemination, and audience. It provides the historical foundation underlying several central debates within current literary theory, including the unstable status of the author, the gendered politics of literary publication, the economics of book distribution, the shifting definition of literary textuality, the history of literary censorship, and the legal evolution of copyright and hypertext in the Digital Age. In order to bring these issues into focus, we will read some influential literary works that stand as particular examples and illustrations within the History of the Book. In addition to landmark examples by Chaucer, Defoe, Sterne, Pope, Blake, Wordsworth, Byron, Hemans, Austen, Dickens, and the Brontes, we will also trace some of the more recent and experimental developments within literary textuality and hypertext. Theoretical readings will include essays by Foucault, Benjamin, Derrida, Borges, Habermas, Darnton, Sutherland, Eisenstein, Eaves, McGann, Woodmansee, Negroponte, Landow, Drucker, and Hayles, among others.

This seminar will examine how the Internet touches on or is touched by many kinds of policy, beginning with technology policy and extending to telecommunications policy, information policy, and more. It will address such questions as: What makes the Internet's technology special--how (and why) does it differ from other approaches to networking, and what do those differences imply? How have its availability and uses been changing, and what do those changes imply? How are the roles of different interest parties (categories of users, government entities, commercial entities, NGOs) evolved, and with what effect? Where is regulation in the context of the Internet? How has the Internet developed as a global construct, and how have different governments and policies affected it? How do responses to the side-effects of Internet use (e.g., privacy and security impacts) affect it? What does growing acceptance of the Internet as infrastructure imply? How might technological advances affect the Internet of the future--and related policy? Students should expect a range of readings, in-class discussion, and paper-writing assignments."

  - :name: "Intro to Culture and Politics: Humanities"
    :number: "043"
    :description: "The course aims to introduce students to the major theoretical paradigms of the politics of culture, and apply them to specific cultural texts and artifacts. The course is based on three main premises: first of all, that all culture is political, if by political we understand the relationship of a work of art to the social order and flows of power. Its intentions and effects can range all the way from affirming to questioning, subverting, transgressing, or protesting prevailing national, class, racial, and gender relations, to name the most pertinent axes of difference. We will ask why some artists explicitly position themselves a nonpolitical, and look at why, and how, some cultural objects obscure political power relations, and others aim to expose them. The objective is to become more conscious and sensitive to how culture positions us vis-\xC3\xA0-vis political power. The second premise is that there is no \xE2\x80\x9Cobjective,\xE2\x80\x9D disinterested stance one can take up, as a scholar, student, or consumer, vis-\xC3\xA0-vis culture, since we are all enmeshed in symbolic systems rather than standing outside of them. Indeed, many of us participate in multiple, sometimes antagonistic cultures, and the ability to translate between them becomes increasingly important, indeed indispensable, to global citizens. The third premise is that there is not a single theory of culture that explains all cultural texts, artifacts, and performances, and how people interact with them. Just as it is valuable to acquire fluency in different local/national/class/gendered etc. cultures, fluency in different theories of culture will enhance our aesthetic appreciation and critical faculties. We will therefore survey and investigate different definitions (aesthetic, anthropological, semiotic), registers (mass, popular, high, avant-garde), and genres (print, visual, performance) of culture."

The course is designed to be broadly comparative, providing training in major socio-cultural, political, and aesthetic theories and emphasizing critical engagement with various disciplinary methodologies and sources. Field 2: Social Sciences of the Culture and Politics Major exposes students to various approaches to the systematic and comparative study of political and cultural institutions and practices. Major texts of the theoretical framework will be placed in the historical context and familiarize the students with related but often opposing views on the interaction of culture and power. The intent is to provide students with a sound understanding of theory and with an appreciation of the complexity of the field as a precondition for a learned debate. We will study the methodology of various disciplinary approaches as this will help better understand the interdisciplinary analysis essential for the study of culture and politics. Classroom discussions will allow for a critical analysis of the value of different approaches and highlight the significance of culturally deterministic positions in contemporary social theory. Finally, in case studies we will examine culture and power in economic, social and human development."

How will these countries provide social services for the elderly and maintain a labor force? \xC2\xB7 Descendants of immigrants who arrived in Europe 30 years ago have come of age with the belief that they should have the same rights and opportunities of all other citizens in their country, only to find out that their last name or perhaps their clothing creates walls that they did not know existed. How will the second-generation integrate and assimilate, or will multiculturalism be tolerated? \xC2\xB7 There is increasing demand from other countries to accept new immigrants. Africans who walked for hundreds of kilometers through the Sahara Desert charged at reinforced fences around the Spanish enclaves of Ceuta and Melilla in September and October of 2005. Many more potential immigrants die each year on boats trying to get to the southern fringes of the EU. What should be the policy response? Who should be allowed in and under what conditions? This course will examine these issues with a focus on the cultural consequences of population strains within the EU and possible policy responses to alter, reverse, or maintain these trends.

  - :name: Economic Development and the Third World
    :number: "381"
    :description: Economic development has been one of the dominant organizing concepts of political and academic discourse for most of the post-1945 period. If, despite the centrality ascribed to it, "catching up with the West" today remains as elusive goal for most of the third world as in the past, this is not because there has not been upward and downward movements on the global ladder of wealth. It is this perpetual and systemic mobility within the world-economy and its provenance, which will form the focal point of this course, and not the historical journey the concept of development undertook or the transformations it underwent over time. We will discuss how ephemeral and short-lived these movements have been when seen from the vantage point of nation-states. Yet, despite the ephemerality of development, the world-economy at the century's end has come to regain and consolidate the globe spanning character it possessed at its beginning which attests to the fact that it is not "national economies" or nation-states which develop but the world-economy as a whole. Investigation of cases of economic mobility, which are of paradigmatic value will therefore allow us to formulate development and depict processes that frame it in a light different from that conveyed by the concept of "national development."

New cinemas demand new theories and these years were no different with film critics and theorists scrambling to find the theoretic al language to discuss films emerging from France, Italy, and Japan after 1945. We begin with how cinema ushered new ways of conceptualizing narrative time and space for a world ravaged by war and colonialism yet enamored by nationalisms. By the seventies, decolonization movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America offered a radically different language of cinema that also informed writings on cinema. In a final move, we will examine the new cinemas emerging from Iran and China offer yet another challenge to redefine narrative time and space.

    :description: Illicit drugs have profound detrimental effects in developing countries, specially in drug producing regions. While the narcotics business has a mixed impact on the economy, it is the underlying cause of violence, political instability, human rights violations, corruption, the spread of AIDS and environmental degradation. National and international efforts at control and strategies and programs for supply and demand reduction have had only limited success and illegal drugs remain a scourge for the developing world. This class will begin with an analysis of the cultural history of intoxicants and then examine the role of drugs in the Third World from the 16 to the 19th century. Special attention will be given to the role of psychoactive substances as a commodity in the making of the global economy. We will then critically examine the impact of the illegal drug industry (production, trafficking and distribution) on development in the Third World in the 2oth century. We will look at the economic, political, social and cultural context of the of supply and demand reduction. Specifically, we will assess the impact of opium/heroin and coca/cocaine in country case studies on Bolivia, Colombia, Afghanistan and Thailand. In our analysis of national and international control efforts we will ask why different societies have sanctioned or prohibited different psychoactive substances at different times. Finally, we will look at the policies and strategies of the United States Government with regard to illegal drugs in the Third World.

We begin with a historical look at the evolution of money and the history of central banking, including the use of the gold standard and the current system of unbacked currency. We then build several basic models of money, using them to study the fundamental links between money, business cycles, and inflation. We use these basic principles to study the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy. One focus is on the role of inflation in helping the government finance its spending, including the tension between the central bank and the fiscal authority. We study these issues using the basic principles of optimal taxation theory. We also study alternative monetary policy instruments, including the term structure of interest rates and government debt. Throughout, we examine how the predictions of our models compare to real-world policies.

Initially students will be asked to give in class presentations of published papers in the field, emphasizing the theoretical and empirical economic techniques, always in light of the regional-specific context. Subsequently students will be invited to choose a topic to study in detail and will write a long paper using the skills developed earlier in the semester.

    :description: This course examines macroeconomics in open economies that are linked by trade, capital flows, and exchange rate policies. The goal is to provide an analytical framework for understanding current events and major challenges facing the world economy. The course will develop theoretical tools that can be used to analyze the economic performance of open economies and to evaluate alternative policy options for macroeconomic management. Topics include balance of payments accounts, foreign exchange and money markets, monetary and stabilization policies, exchange rate regimes, the capital inflows problem, currency and financial crises, and the international financial architecture. Case studies from historical and recent experiences will be closely and critically examined.

This course concentrates on a subset of these developments: The integration of the goods market (trade) and of factor markets (foreign direct investment and labor mobility). The course follows a dual strategy, beginning with an examination of theoretical issues arising in each of the aforementioned areas, such as the determinants of trade patterns, the income distribution consequences of opening trade, the motives for capital and labor mobility, etc. These concepts are then applied specifically to the case of Europe, including the relevant economic history, the current institutional framework, the observed effects of liberalization on trade and income patterns and the remaining obstacles."

    :description: This course will provide a practical quantitative exercise in identifying, estimating, and designing policy responses to problems of macroeconomic instability in developing, emerging, and transition economies. Students will calculate indicators used in assessing macroeconomic balance (such as rates of growth and inflation, the relative fiscal deficit, and change in the real exchange rate), and use statistical tools to analyze alternative policy outcomes. The quantitative tools will be introduced in the course. Students will write a paper describing their results for classroom presentation and discussion. Undergraduate course members may write their papers in two-person teams. In their papers, authors apply quantitative assessment and policy design tools to a country and macroeconomic episode of their choosing--for example, spiraling inflation in Argentina at the end of the 1980s, balance of payments developments in Mexico in the run-up to the 1994 election, the growth rate in the Philippines in the late-Marcos and early-Aquino years, or monetary expansion in the Ukraine after early transition. The course focuses on short-run macroeconomic stabilization issues (rather than on growth, income distribution, or development in general) and on basic quantitative tools. Those with backgrounds in econometrics can make use of sophisticated statistical techniques in the estimation part of the course, but estimates based on simpler methods are fully acceptable. This course will be useful to upperclass-undergraduates and M.A. students in MSB, SFS, and area studies M.A. programs who have an interest and/or potential career involvement in country macroeconomic assessment, the environment for investment, currency and balance of payments analysis, achievement of short-run macroeconomic performance objectives, globalization issues, and/or practices and policies of international financial institutions. In addition to the two regular lecture sessions per week, there will be an optional evening lab session for additional help and/or office hours. Spring. Same as ECON 331

Econ 603 is highly recommended, but because of scheduling problems it is not a formal prerequisite for the class. Your final grade will be based on one mid-term (40%) and a final exam (60%). The complete syllabus for this class is not finalized yet. The material covered will be a combination of topics in Bounded Rationality and Contract Theory. Last, but NOT LEAST, a word of caution about MATH. This Class DOES involve some hard math. Though not all topics covered require it, the math used in some parts of the course exceeds that used in Econ 601, 602 and 603. This does not mean that I expect students to know the mathematical tools involved; we will pick them up as we go along.

    :description: This course applies the principles of microeconomics to the study of how healthcare markets work. From this perspective, we will explore why the healthcare system is fractured and what this implies for access to care, the cost of care, and the quality of care. The unique nature of healthcare requires understanding the institutional arrangements that shape and respond to market forces. Market inadequacies and market failures have also resulted in government interventions, which in turn have affected the healthcare market. Perhaps the most unique aspect of healthcare is the role of employer-provided health insurance and the peculiar way in which labor markets are effected. Employer-provided health insurance and healthcare coverage from public programs like Medicare and Medicaid, not only serve as the primary sources of financing healthcare, they have a large role in shaping how care is organized and delivered. Furthermore there are critical gaps in who is covered, what is covered, as well as overlapping coverage that provides perverse incentives for the efficient and effective provision of care. Given the role of public policy, and the relationship between public policies and politics, this course will touch on the relationship between politics, policies, and healthcare markets.

    :description: "Political Economy and International Political Economy are fast growing fields of study that focus on the methodological and substantive intersection of economics and political science. This class emphasizes the methodological tools and techniques that underlie much of the current research in this field. These models and techniques allow us to structure our thinking about fundamental concepts regarding the nature of political and economic preferences, the problems of preference aggregation and the link between policy preferences and policy outcomes, problems of collective action, and strategic interaction. Mastering these tools and techniques is important for understanding the major works in the field and contributing to it. Students are expected to use these tools and techniques in courses throughout the PECO/IPEC majors to analyze substantive issues of the field (such as economic development, the politics of trade or finance, government-business relations, etc.). Most important, all students will be required to write a article-length research paper on a topic of their choosing during the spring of the senior year as part of PECO/IPEC401. In that paper, students are expected to apply the analytical techniques learned in this course and their statistics courses. Throughout the major, students are encouraged to keep a notebook of ideas and topics that they find interesting which could serve as the foundation of their PECO/IPEC401 paper. This course is team-taught by a political scientist and economist. Prerequisites: Microeconomic Theory (ECON-101) and one foundation government course. Note that ECON-101 has Microeconomic Principles (ECON-001) and Elementary Calculus (MATH-035) as prerequisites."

    :description: This course will provide a practical quantitative exercise in identifying, estimating, and designing policy responses to problems of macroeconomic instability in developing, emerging, and transition economies. Students will calculate indicators used in assessing macroeconomic balance (such as rates of growth and inflation, the relative fiscal deficit, and change in the real exchange rate), and use statistical tools to analyze alternative policy outcomes. The quantitative tools will be introduced in the course. Students will write a paper describing their results for classroom presentation and discussion. Undergraduate course members may write their papers in two-person teams. In their papers, authors apply quantitative assessment and policy design tools to a country and macroeconomic episode of their choosing--for example, spiraling inflation in Argentina at the end of the 1980s, balance of payments developments in Mexico in the run-up to the 1994 election, the growth rate in the Philippines in the late-Marcos and early-Aquino years, or monetary expansion in the Ukraine after early transition. The course focuses on short-run macroeconomic stabilization issues (rather than on growth, income distribution, or development in general) and on basic quantitative tools. Those with backgrounds in econometrics can make use of sophisticated statistical techniques in the estimation part of the course, but estimates based on simpler methods are fully acceptable. This course will be useful to upperclass-undergraduates and M.A. students in MSB, SFS, and area studies M.A. programs who have an interest and/or potential career involvement in country macroeconomic assessment, the environment for investment, currency and balance of payments analysis, achievement of short-run macroeconomic performance objectives, globalization issues, and/or practices and policies of international financial institutions.

    :description: "Spring 2007 Medieval Literatures and Culture This course will consider three aspects of cultural formation in medieval societies: ideology, violence, and gender. Why these three? Each of them is a prominent subject of literary study today in all periods, as is \"cultural formation\" itself, and all of them are important subjects of investigation in other disciplines, such as anthropology, psychology, sociology, and social history, which continue to affect, to broaden, and to interact with the study of literature. Our focus will be on two cultures in medieval Europe, which we will attempt to treat comparatively. The first is Nordic or Viking culture of the 8th to the 11th centuries, encompassing the peoples of Scandinavia, Iceland, and (after the Danish invasions) England. We will begin with Nordic mythology and religion from Snorri Sturlusson's Prose Edda: the Nordic creation story of fire and ice, the world-ash Yggdrasil, the encircling world-serpent Jormungandr, the war of the gods and the giants, Thor, Oden, and Loki. Then we will read several Icelandic sagas from the Viking period-Njals Saga, Hrafnkels Saga, and Laxdaela Saga, the first forms of prose fiction in the West- and will study the evolution of Icelandic law and feud customs, and the role of women in Nordic society. The final work from this period is the epic English poem Beowulf, where arguably literature in English begins. Reflecting the early history of England as an oft-invaded, often colonized nation, the poem, though in English, is set in Scandinavia and refracts English fears (and mythologization) of societal violence through the smoky lens of ancient Nordic history. The second culture we will focus on might be called \"romance culture,\" in part because it is largely confined to the romance languages, but also because \"literary romance,\" particularly Arthurian romance, is its characterizing genre. Romance culture of the 12th to the 14th centuries, like Nordic culture, was not confined within national boundaries. Hence, from France we will read Chr\xC3\xA9tien de Troyes Lancelot and Yvain, and from England, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. We will also study the evolution of chivalric ideology as a major cultural phenomenon arising from the collapse of older feudal relations. This new ideology brings in its train at least two major formations that affected the history of Europe for 500 years: romantic love (and with it a new conception of womanhood) and knighthood (and with it a new conception of manhood). To study the new romantic love, we will read Andreas Capellanus' Art of Courtly Love. On knighthood, we will read selections from Maurice Keen's Chivalry and from the works of Georges Duby and Jacques Le Goff on the medieval \"cultural imaginary.\" And from the end of the 14th century, we will read a classic anti-romance put ironically into the mouth of a woman: Chaucer's Wife of Bath's Tale. Finally, having seen that the term medieval has come to embrace these two widely disparate cultures, chronologically and ideologically utterly different, we will consider the origins and distortions of the terms \"medieval\" and \"Middle Ages\"- invented by a later age- and what might be called \"the politics of periodization.\" The course will be conducted as much as possible as a seminar, with students taking shared responsibility for discussions. There will be frequent short papers and two longer papers during the semester, with an emphasis on the writing and revising process."

Fall 2005 Only Professor Pfordresher Many poets write within a matrix of long-standing artistic traditions. But rather than simply repeat the achievements of the past they use their own individual voices to transform the practice of poetry for their era. In this course we will study how this happens in the work of five writers: Wordsworth, Byron, Keats, Tennyson, and Hopkins. During class discussion we will look closely at traditional forms such as the sonnet, the ode, the elegy, and the poetic narrative and we will consider the ends they serve. We will be particularly attentive to the music of poetry as it sounds.

How do we understand these terms in relationship to each other and in the various cultural and historical contexts in which they are often used? Are there differences between the use of these terms in the visual and the literary arts? Through careful analysis of a number of films, literary works, and critical theory, this course will begin to answer these and other fundamental questions about modernism and postmodernism. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which certain writers and filmmakers self-consciously foreground the act of writing (or of making film) in their works. Texts for the course will include works by Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Katherine Anne Porter, John Fowles, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Thomas Pynchon, and Margaret Atwood, as well as a number of critical essays. We will also look at the issues of modernism and postmodernism in such films as Man with a Movie Camera, Rear Window, The Matrix, and Adaptation.

  - :name: "Gateway: Introduction to Critical Methods"
    :number: "043"
    :description: "The course aims to introduce students to the major theoretical paradigms of the politics of culture, and apply them to specific cultural texts and artifacts. The course is based on three main premises: first of all, that all culture is political, if by political we understand the relationship of a work of art to the social order and flows of power. Its intentions and effects can range all the way from affirming to questioning, subverting, transgressing, or protesting prevailing national, class, racial, and gender relations, to name the most pertinent axes of difference. We will ask why some artists explicitly position themselves a nonpolitical, and look at why, and how, some cultural objects obscure political power relations, and others aim to expose them. The objective is to become more conscious and sensitive to how culture positions us vis-\xC3\xA0-vis political power. The second premise is that there is no \xE2\x80\x9Cobjective,\xE2\x80\x9D disinterested stance one can take up, as a scholar, student, or consumer, vis-\xC3\xA0-vis culture, since we are all enmeshed in symbolic systems rather than standing outside of them. Indeed, many of us participate in multiple, sometimes antagonistic cultures, and the ability to translate between them becomes increasingly important, indeed indispensable, to global citizens. The third premise is that there is not a single theory of culture that explains all cultural texts, artifacts, and performances, and how people interact with them. Just as it is valuable to acquire fluency in different local/national/class/gendered etc. cultures, fluency in different theories of culture will enhance our aesthetic appreciation and critical faculties. We will therefore survey and investigate different definitions (aesthetic, anthropological, semiotic), registers (mass, popular, high, avant-garde), and genres (print, visual, performance) of culture."

We will examine excerpts from readings focused on the French Revolution of 1789 and some philosophical musings on defining and justifying/criticizing revolution in general to introduce our wondering about the causes and effects of those revolutions that followed: developments in industry, science and technology; the expansion of workers\xE2\x80\x99 rights; changing political and sociological expectations and awareness of gender and class; new perspectives on knowledge and education; expanding perceptions of the physical world; risks in creation of the arts and experiments in their display/production before public audiences. The majority of the class meetings will focus on student led research of various revolutions that they will suggest as ways to read the portion of the novel assigned for that day\xE2\x80\x99s discussion.

  - :name: Re-membering Empire
    :number: "197"
    :description: This course examines representations of empire building in nineteenth century literature and also in contemporary literature set in the nineteenth century. What was the relation between literature and empire in the nineteenth century? Did some literary works function as propaganda for empire building? Were some literary works sites of national and cultural debate about imperialism, race, and gender? How do current writers look back at the nineteenth century and imagine stories about imperialism? Are those imaginings only about the past? Or are they temporal displacements of debates about imperialism now? Collectively, we will generate a theory of imperialist discourse, exploring such topics and tropes as Otherness, the rhetoric of racial and sexual violence, rank and class, and cultural memory. The course takes a comparative approach by including works that reference British imperialism and works that reference the emergence of U.S. imperialism. Some of the works are well known pieces of "literature," while others are examples of nineteenth century popular culture and performance. Course readings may include works by Edward Said, Jane Austen, and David Malouf. The course is discussion based and requires verbal participation by everyone every day, as well as frequent essays and one research paper.

    :description: "This course, required for the program, is an interdisciplinary introduction to medieval culture. It focuses on a pivotal 50 year period in the high Middle Ages, 1275-1325, roughly the period of Dante's life, but also a period of major developments in the history of the papacy, the Holy Roman Empire, the development of the city, vernacular literature, medieval art and architecture, the universities, optics, astronomy, music, banking and trade, European-Islamic cultural relations, and much more. The central text will be Dante's Divine Comedy, but our approach will be interdisciplinary and we will also read works by Augustine, Boethius, Virgil, Italian poets (Guinizelli, Cavalcante) and historians (Dino Compagni) contemporary with Dante. We will study the Lorenzetti frescoes painted in the Palazzo Publico in Siena and some works of Giotto. We will also read several other works of Dante: the Vita Nuova on love; the De Monarchia for political theory; and the De Vulgari Eloquentia for Dante's theory of language.

In particular, we will investigate how their perception of America, coupled with their interaction with modern art and with each other, stimulated an experiment in realignment of traditional American values with corresponding innovative literary techniques. Short stories by Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Gertrude Stein; novels by Hemingway, Fitzgerald and Virginia Woolf; poetry by Ezra Pound, Hilda Doolittle, e.e. cummings and T. S. Eliot. (Virginia Woolf was not American, but a significant feminist contemporary.) Students in this four credit course will also research, create, and offer a power point presentation\xE2\x80\x94either individually or in a group\xE2\x80\x94on selected issues to further enrich our study of the period.

Moving from the contexts of myth-making and law to politics, economics, and education, we will consider how Asian American writers have intervened in American institutions and policies. How have they responded to U.S. ideologies that have historically identified Asian Americans as perpetual \xE2\x80\x9Caliens\xE2\x80\x9D? Paying particular attention to the development of Asian American narratives, languages, politics, and identity, we will be investigating the ways in which these works represent a unified Asian American perspective, even as we differentiate on the basis of ethnicity, gender, class background, and sexual orientation. Finally, we will contextualize our readings with the current debates over the state of race, multiculturalism, and Asian America at the start of the twenty-first century. In every way, this class is organized around the concept of class engagement. It is important that students think consistently about the issues and works we are discussing, come to each class prepared to offer analysis of the reading for that day, and make every effort to understand how the course is asking them to read, think, and write differently.

Properly to understand Eliot's opus, however, requires reading its principal allusions: Scripture (Old and New), Dante, Virgil, St. Augustine, Tarot cards, fertility gods and rituals, Grail Knight romances, Shakespeare, Thomas Kyd, Baudelaire, and the Baghavad Gita--virtually a liberal arts curriculum in itself.

As an omnipresent site of entertainment and information, "reality" and fantasy, "quality" and "trash," and commerce and the public interest, television requires an active, critical interrogation of its texts, uses, and production of meaning. This course will set aside evaluative considerations of TV in favor of theoretical and critical approaches that challenge widespread, yet uninformed, assumptions about the medium. Such approaches include, but are not limited to, post-structuralism, reception studies, cultural studies, semiotics, genre theory, and narrative theory. Attendance in weekly screenings is required.

Among the many questions we\xE2\x80\x99ll be considering this semester are the following: --What distinguishes autobiography from fiction? --Does it matter if a subject tells the truth in her autobiography? --Do men and women tell their stories differently and is it liberating or damaging to argue for gender difference in writing? --Can women ever really write their lives truthfully through autobiography if it is, as many scholars argue, an inherently male genre? Are there really such things as \xE2\x80\x9Cwomen\xE2\x80\x99s autobiographies\xE2\x80\x9D? --Why is autobiography such an enormously popular genre at this moment? --What, if anything, about the language and worldview of these autobiographies makes them distinctively American? --Is the self perceived or created through writing?

Students will also write their own five page autobiographical essay and a five page critique of that essay-writing experience.

Students will study critical writing and investigate its influence; they will also practice the art of critical writing in weekly assignments. The course will begin by exploring early twentieth-century culture critics such as H.L. Mencken and the wits of the Round Table. It will then continue through the mid-century with the rise of the New York Intellectuals (e.g. Edmund Wilson, Irving Howe and Mary McCarthy) and the emergence of post-1960s public intellectuals out of the New Left and Conservative political movements (e.g. Todd Gitlin, Barbara Ehrenreich, and William Kristol). The course will conclude with a study of the growth of the African-American public intellectual (e.g. Cornell West, Toni Morrison). Fall 2005 Only Professor Lane This seminar introduces the phenomenon of journalistic fraud as well as various ideas about its origins and consequences. The premise, to be elaborated through a series of case studies, is that fiction has recurrently masqueraded as fact throughout the history of the American press, and such fraud has taken a variety of forms, ranging from the systemic to the spectacular. Journalistic fraud will be taken seriously as an ethical breach--and one that threatens the legitimacy of a crucial democratic institution--but students will be challenged to test the assumptions that underlie this approach. In particular, the class will examine skeptically the bright lines that assertedly separate unethical journalism from acceptable practices. The goal is a realistic, nuanced sense of what the press can and cannot expect to achieve in its professed quest for objective truth. (Note: This is not a course in \xE2\x80\x9Cmedia bias.\xE2\x80\x9D Deconstructionism and postmodern literary theory are also not on the agenda.)

    :description: British eighteenth-century studies has been marked by claims of novelty, most notably by Felicity Nussbaum's somewhat inflammatory essay collection, The New Eighteenth Century published in 1987. This course examines various eighteenth-century primary texts in light of the "old" criticism, "new" theory as represented by a wave of work published in the wake of Nussbaum's collection, and current work in the field. We will take as our primary texts Robinson Crusoe, Windsor Forest and The Rape of the Lock, sections of Pamela and Tom Jones, selections from Samuel Johnson's works, Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard, and The Romance of the Forest. Critical texts will be drawn from Martin Battestin, Walter Jackson Bates, Laura Brown, Susan Stewart, Laura Rosenthal, Helen Deutsch and others. The course will include a number of quizzes on content and require a presentation, eight shorter response papers, and a longer, final essay.

    :description: "This seminar will examine five of Charles Dickens=s major novels in great detail. Students will be expected to do extensive research for each novel and to present sections of the booksBas well as to include a range of critical approaches, historical and biographical contexts, and problematic themes and issues to discuss as a group (one hour of the two-hour class). Each small-group presentation will be followed by individual short papers (3-4 pages) to be written by individual members of the group and turned in one week subsequent to the presentation. All students will write one-page response/critical reading papers each week (8 in all), designed to raise questions about the text and to isolate particular passages for discussion. These papers will be distributed via email to all members of the class at least 24 hours before it meets. A long research paper (15-20 pages) with an original thesis will also be required. Students are responsible for developing their own topics for these essays, submitting a formal prospectus and annotated bibliography, and presenting a draft of the essay two weeks before the end of term, with other students designated to read and critique their work. Required texts: Oliver Twist, Hard Times, Bleak House, Great Expectations, and Our Mutual Friend, as well as Edgar Johnson's biography, other (short) works by Dickens and his contemporaries, selected literary theory, and criticism of individual books."

Mr. Joyce\xE2\x80\x99s indecency in Ulysses seems to me the conscious and calculated indecency of a desperate man who feels that in order to breathe he must break the windows. At moments, when the window is broken, he is magnificent. But what a waste of energy!\xE2\x80\x9D In this course, we will discuss the similarities and differences between two of the most well known writers of the Modernism, a period that broke ground (and windows) with the Victorian traditions that came before. We will look at what Woolf means by this wasted energy of Joyce\xE2\x80\x99s, and how both Joyce and Woolf define new literary boundaries that had a profound influence on their contemporaries and the subsequent generations of writers. While we will discuss the historical and cultural contexts in which they were writing and to which they were responding, our primary focus will be on understanding their development of new literary techniques that came to define modernist writing. Texts for the course will include Mrs. Dalloway, To the Lighthouse, The Waves, Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Ulysses, with additional selections from their other writings as well as from critical and theoretical works relevant to our discussion."

  - :name: Introduction to Critical Theory
    :number: "712"
    :description: "While the phrase \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical theory\xE2\x80\x9D was initially coined in the mid-20th century to name the work done by mostly Marxist intellectuals to make more practical sense of how both high- and mass-cultural production participated in either the legitimization or subversion of the operations of industrialized capital, it has since that moment come to mean more generally the history (initially Western, more recently post-colonial, and even global) of intellectual attempts to make sense of, and even to intervene into, the operations of culture in all its most salient contexts (political, economic, social, historical, technological). This course will survey the most influential figures and statements in that latter construction of \xE2\x80\x9Ccritical theory,\xE2\x80\x9D but with a keen interest in how, and why, that latter construction came to subsume the former. While no one problem, question, or theme will govern the selection of topics or readings, or even guide most discussions, the course will devote significant attention to the fate of critical theory, and of intellectual labor more generally, in what many have been calling our post-historical, post-cultural and certainly post-theoretical moment. Course readings will consist primarily of essay-length selections collected in at least one anthology (most likely Rivkin and Ryan\xE2\x80\x99s Literary Theory: an Anthology) and across a short list of representative monographs of fairly recent vintage (candidates include Fredric Jameson\xE2\x80\x99s The Cultural Turn, Judith Butler\xE2\x80\x99s Excitable Speech, and George Y\xC3\xBAdice\xE2\x80\x99s The Expediency of Culture).

    :description: "This seminar explores the relationships between literacy and law. The course will explore learning theories and practices regarding emergent literacy and examine their legal and social implications. Readings will be drawn from three areas: educational theory and practice, law, and children\xE2\x80\x99s literature. The course will focus upon whole language and other approaches which now inform literacy instruction in America. Legal implications to be considered may include restrictions on literacy due to slavery and educational disadvantage, statutory interpretation, equal protection and diversity, freedom of speech, school finance, discipline, and English as a second language. In order to provide practical experience in emergent literacy, students are required to participate in a practicum of at least one hour per week in which they work with a student in emergent literacy. The practicum may be a tutorial or literacy program sponsored by the Law Center (normally, the beginning reading program at Sursum Corda community near the Law Center) or some other arrangement approved by the instructors. Writing requirements include both a journal and short paper. The seminar is also open to graduate students in the Department of English, with permission of the instructor.

  - :name: "History of the Book: Theory of Text"
    :number: "687"
    :description: "How does English literature change as we move from oral to scribal to print culture--and from the material to the digital text? How did the serialization of Victorian novels in periodicals affect their composition, distribution, and readership? And how is the literary history of particular eras inflected by such cultural influences as law, economics, and technology? Such questions are central to \"The History of the Book\"\xE2\x80\x94that is, the understanding of literary texts as both material artifacts and potentially disembodied (electronic) forms. This course offers students of literature an opportunity to explore some of the cultural and historical concepts behind such issues as literary authorship, forgery, piracy, translation, production, dissemination, and audience. It provides the historical foundation underlying several central debates within current literary theory, including the unstable status of the author, the gendered politics of literary publication, the economics of book distribution, the shifting definition of literary textuality, the history of literary censorship, and the legal evolution of copyright and hypertext in the Digital Age. In order to bring these issues into focus, we will read some influential literary works that stand as particular examples and illustrations within the History of the Book. In addition to landmark examples by Chaucer, Defoe, Sterne, Pope, Blake, Wordsworth, Byron, Hemans, Austen, Dickens, and the Brontes, we will also trace some of the more recent and experimental developments within literary textuality and hypertext. Theoretical readings will include essays by Foucault, Benjamin, Derrida, Borges, Habermas, Darnton, Sutherland, Eisenstein, Eaves, McGann, Woodmansee, Negroponte, Landow, Drucker, and Hayles, among others."

We will investigate the varied ways in which classic Russian authors and their readers (including our contemporaries, who grow up in Russia reading these works) pose the many convoluted questions related to the pursuit of love and happiness. How does one define happiness? What is a (or the) good life? How is romantic passion related to happiness and personal freedom? Finally, how do these authors perceive the role of society, gender, national identity, and religion within this complex equation, and how do those issues interact with the genre of the novel and the adultery plot? In this section we will read Tolstoy\xE2\x80\x99s great Anna Karenina (1877) and its Russian precursors: Pushkin\xE2\x80\x99s Eugene Onegin (1830), Herzen\xE2\x80\x99s Who Is to Blame?

    :number: "112"
    :description: "In this course we will explore various modes of performance in late medieval England in light of both medieval and contemporary theories of performance, ritual, and theater. Drama itself will be a significant focus; in particular, we will seek to gain an in-depth understanding of the great Corpus Christi cycles, examining their origins, the theories of \xE2\x80\x9Cplay\xE2\x80\x9D that motivate them, their robust humor and its relation to their theological aims, their function in both supporting and contesting ideals of civic unity, the ways they seek to construct and channel emotional response, and their tendency to collapse distinctions between spectator and spectacle, elite and popular, sacred and profane. But an equally important aim of the course is to investigate the performative aspects of late-medieval English culture more generally. Thus we will consider topics such as the oral performance of lyrics, romances, and sermons; the performativity of legal language and the language of Christian ritual; participatory affective piety, including the use of holy dolls, meditative writings, and devotional objects; civic processions and public executions; dance, gesture, and body language in both sacred and secular contexts; gender performance, including cross-dressing; and conduct books and other scripts written for the performance of everyday life. Prerequisite: a genuine willingness to learn Middle English. Since all primary texts will be in the original, an initial introduction to Middle English will be followed by weekly language exercises -- both written and oral. Students can expect to emerge as adept readers and performers of this rich and musical ancestor of our common tongue."

    :number: "134"
    :description: "As a cultural icon, Shakespeare has often been subjected to adaptation and appropriation by artists working in numerous genres. Not many of these latter-day Bards, however, respond to Shakespeare using his own dramatic idiom, invading his home turf of the playhouse to mount a radical, often controversial critique. This course thus pairs classic Shakespearean plays with provocative reworkings by contemporary playwrights, using comparative analysis and dramatic interpretation to examine changing notions of gender, class, race, empire, power, and history. By exploring how contemporary playwrights restage (or upstage) Shakespeare\xE2\x80\x99s master narratives, we will open up larger issues concerning the politics of genre: can a transgressive viewpoint be adequately housed within a traditional literary structure? In post-colonial terms, can the key to the master\xE2\x80\x99s house be found within the master\xE2\x80\x99s architectonics? Using well-known texts such as Hamlet, Othello, and The Tempest as a springboard, we will consider how these canonical works play out against such upstarts as Suleyman al-Hassan\xE2\x80\x99s The Al-Hamlet Summit, Tom Stoppard\xE2\x80\x99s Rosencrantz and Guildensten are Dead, Ann-Marie MacDonald\xE2\x80\x99s Goodnight Desdemona (Good Morning Juliet), Timothy Findley\xE2\x80\x99s Elizabeth Rex, and Aim\xC3\xA9 C\xC3\xA9saire\xE2\x80\x99s A Tempest."

    :description: "Early modern England experienced substantial religious upheavals in its departure from the Catholic Church and establishment of the Protestant Church of England. In their struggle to define a new religious identity, the English often explored the ways in which they differed not only from other Christians but also non-Christians. In this course we will read sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English plays which represent some of these concerns in their accounts of two non-Christian religious traditions: Judaism and Islam. We will consider the significance of these representations both to discover what the English thought about religious difference as well as what these thoughts reveal about English culture. We will also attend to the ways in which representations of religious difference intersect with early modern ideas of race and gender."

The discoveries of the \"New Science,\" as it was called, opened up previously unimaginable new worlds by means of the telescope and microscope, and the theories of Newton initiated a thorough rethinking of the nature of the physical (and therefore spiritual) universe; the colonization of the New World brought different cultures -- African, Amerindian, and European -- into violent collision and forced many thinkers to struggle with the complexities of cultural relativism; and new forces of economic and social change redefined the roles of both men and women and upset traditional notions of hierarchy and class. In this class, we will examine the ways many people responded to this sometimes exhilarating, sometimes frightening onslaught of modernity. Readings include /Oroonoko/; Rowlandson\xE2\x80\x99s account of her captivity by the Narragansetts; Swift's /Gulliver\xE2\x80\x99s Travels/; /Moll Flanders/; poems by Alexander Pope; the autobiographies of Olaudah Equiano and Benjamin Franklin; Brown; /Edgar Huntly/; and Austen's /Emma/.

This course will explore the implications of this statement as it relates to eighteenth-century British novelists of both genders and the \xE2\x80\x98Others\xE2\x80\x99 described in their texts. We will consider the validity of Azim\xE2\x80\x99s claim as well as excavate the origins of the modern novel form by using a very specific thematic lens: colonialism. Since a significant number of the canonical and non-canonical texts that are associated with the origins and rise of the novel frequently employ the colonial Other\xE2\x80\x94both as geographic space and narrative individual\xE2\x80\x94we will approach the novel\xE2\x80\x99s development as a form that went hand-in-hand with Britain\xE2\x80\x99s plan for colonial expansion. The novel, perhaps, provided Britons with justification and inspiration for this plan. To explore these ends we will consider eighteenth-century British novelists\xE2\x80\x99 obsessions with colonialism\xE2\x80\x94obsessions that, curiously, begin and reach their height in novels written by British women.

These performers may be regarded as \xE2\x80\x9Ccritics\xE2\x80\x9D because they all, in disparate ways, passed judgments on American culture; furthermore, they did not, as twenty-first century scholars do, worry about genre distinctions. Instead, they moved from one creative realm to another with ease. We will study the varied and complicated strategies that these critics used to gain access to the public sphere and to redefine the seemingly private sphere. For example, to protect their status as respectable wives and mothers, many women voiced their concerns indirectly, composing ballads and poems rife with hidden meanings, instead of publishing non-fiction commentaries. Others published their work anonymously, or under a male or female pseudonym. Still others populated the stage with dramatic characters who were bolder than they themselves could be. We will analyze the implications of the women\xE2\x80\x99s various avenues toward publication as well as their actual songs, poems, lectures, plays, and autobiographical novels.

Students will have an opportunity to study the varied and complicated strategies that female anti-slavery writers and speakers used to gain access to the public sphere or to redefine the \xE2\x80\x9Cprivate\xE2\x80\x9D sphere so that they could perform their sense of an emancipated America. Many activists found it difficult to publish their critiques as non-fiction, so they fictionalized their stories, composing ballads and poems instead of essays. Other abolitionists published their work anonymously, or under a male or female pseudonym. We will analyze the implications of the women\xE2\x80\x99s various avenues toward publication as well as their actual anti-slavery poems, essays, plays, speeches, short stories, letters, and autobiographical novels. Our theoretical readings and archival adventures will help us illuminate how female anti-slavery advocates shaped and reshaped the intersecting performances of womanhood, \xE2\x80\x9Crace,\xE2\x80\x9D sexuality and American-ness. Our readings will include Phillis Wheatley, Judith Sargeant Murray, Susanna Haswell Rowson, Maria W. Stewart, Lydia Maria Child, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and a host of lesser-known anti-slavery lecturers and essayists. We will analyze these women\xE2\x80\x99s publications within the context of contemporaneous debates about (in)visibility, identity, \xE2\x80\x9Crace,\xE2\x80\x9D and nation in an effort to understand the tangled performance of anti-slavery in the United States. During the first half of the term, you will have a chance to investigate archival materials contemporaneous with a particular anti-slavery advocate\xE2\x80\x99s writings; in the second half of the term, you will be able to study archival materials written by the women abolitionists themselves.

  - :name: Gothic Novel and Its Aftermath
    :number: "191"
    :description: The late eighteenth-century Gothic novel in England was both wildly popular and potentially shocking to contemporary sensibilities, dealing as it did with topics such as abduction, rape, supernatural forces, and secret sacrilegious rituals. But alongside the sensationalistic aspects of the Gothic novel is also frequently a sustained, though distorted, examination of the social and cultural anxieties of the age that produced it, anxieties frequently of sexual, religious, or national transgression. This course will move from the traditional Gothic novel to some of its later manifestation in the nineteenth century, analyzing the ways in which shifting moral, scientific, and social contexts shaped the dystopic world of the Gothic. At the same time, it will explore the relationship of certain formal conventions of the Gothic novel (including structure and narrative technique) to this broader cultural work. Texts will include The Castle of Otranto, The Mysteries of Udolpho, The Monk, Zofloya, Melmoth the Wanderer, Carmilla, and Dracula. As a four-credit class, this course will have a substantial theoretical component, including critical essays on form, gender, national identity, race, and sexuality as they relate to the development of the Gothic as a mode. Also, students will be expected to engage in significant archival research in the 18th- and/or 19th-century collections at the Library of Congress in preparation for a final paper that contextualizes a Gothic narrative within its cultural and historical context.

    :description: "This course takes as its focus how class as social identification is signified in a diverse array of 19th-C American literary texts. Starting with the premise that a historically-specific psychoanalytic approach can illuminate the complexities of class subjectivity and \xE2\x80\x9Cexperience\xE2\x80\x9D in the 19th-C (and in the present), we will begin by sampling contemporary theoretical discussions of identification, with an eye toward explicating how such accounts can help illuminate what Richard Sennett and Jonathan Cobb describe as the \xE2\x80\x9Chidden injuries of class.\xE2\x80\x9D Overall in the course, through a discussion of a variety of theoretical, historical, and literary texts, we will explore the American Dream of unencumbered class mobility as a particular formation of what critic Lauren Berlant terms \"national fantasy,\" a utopian national ideal at once deemed universally accessible and inscribed by differences of race, gender, sexuality, region, and nationality. We will examine the way 19th-C American literary texts both reproduce, and expose the limits of and/or contradictions within, this governing ideology of Americanness: we will consider the ways in which literary texts both envision the distance between utopian ideal and historical \xE2\x80\x9Creality,\xE2\x80\x9D and register the invisible psychic and social costs of subscription to this national ideal. Course readings will likely include: theoretical, historical, and critical essays by Wendy Brown, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Hortense Spillers, Anne Cheng, Carolyn Kay Steedman, Michael Rogin, Hazel Carby, Eric Lott, David Roediger, Claudia Tate; and 19th-C literary texts by Ben Franklin, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Maria Cummins, Herman Melville, Lowell millwoman and author Sarah Bagley, Walt Whitman, Frank Webb, Horatio Alger, Theodore Dreiser, Pauline Hopkins, Stephen Crane, and Edith Wharton."

  - :name: The Frontier and the City in American Literature
    :number: "202"
    :description: "The Frontier and the City in American Literature The historian Frederick Jackson Turner declared in 1893 that the frontier of the North American continent had been instrumental in shaping \xE2\x80\x9Cthe American character,\xE2\x80\x9D influencing its societies, economies, and political systems from before the European settlement of North America through the nineteenth century. An acute consciousness of the power and the potential of the environment marks the literature of the early United States and especially of the nineteenth century, as the frontier was contested and redefined and, eventually, according to Turner, closed. This course will explore how the representation of the frontier in American literature became a field upon which concepts of race, gender, class, and individual and national identity competed and were articulated. It will then consider how American literature dealt with the losing of the frontier by the end of the nineteenth century and the emergence of the city as the \xE2\x80\x9Cnew frontier\xE2\x80\x9D of a twentieth- and twenty-first century nation transformed by technology, urbanization, and its international role. Texts primarily from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries will include short fiction and non-fiction by writers such as Hawthorne, Emerson, and Dickinson; novels by writers such as Wharton, Fitzgerald, and Ellison; literary criticism and environmental history; and visual texts such as painting, film, and architecture."

    :number: "204"
    :description: A prominent literary critic claimed recently that America is defined by its commitments to cultural democracy, political rights, community responsibility, social justice, an equality of opportunity, and individual freedom. In this survey, we are going to examine how the literature of America written during this period of national reconciliation grapples with turning these ideals into reality. As we are about to discover, the meaning of these terms is anything but clear and the values they convey are often found to be in conflict with each other. In the final two weeks, we will consider how American literary modernism attempts to break with its past both through its experiments in literary form and its nativist politics.

    :description: New York City is, arguably the cultural capital of twentieth- (and, so far), twenty-first century America - the center of literature, music, art, architecture, and fashion as well as the focal point for political debates on the viability of cities, immigration, and the meaning of America itself. This course proposes to study autobiographical, fictional, non-fictional, poetic and cinematic accounts of twentieth-century life in New York City in order to understand the dreams and nightmares embodied by the city in the popular imagination. Beginning with the first decades of the twentieth century, we will investigate the decline of the "old guard" aristocratic society in the early 1900s and the nature of the immigrant experience in New York. The course will then focus on the Jazz Age when New York artists, writers, and architects shaped a new ethos of modernity that would define "The American Century." Attention will also be devoted to the various "counter-cultural" movements (e.g. the rise of the American Communist Part, the Beat Movement) that erupted in New York City during the early and middle decades of the last century. The course will conclude with contemporary dystopian and stubbonly utopian predictions about the future of New York City and urban life in America.

    :number: "213"
    :description: "Once regarded as a race-specific, class-specific expression of marginal resistance in the United States, hip/hop has since been appropriated and commodified to the extent that it has become in many aspects consistent with the conventions of mainstream Americana. In this course we will examine the history, development, and representation of hip/hop culture, discussing each of its constitutive, interdependent elements as well as their many derivatives. Class sessions will be arranged according to specific themes pertaining to such issues as community construction and constructive regionalism, black cultural production and conceptions of authenticity, celebrity and the valuation of mortality, mediated sexualities and the performance of masculinity, nationalized aesthetics and technologies of globalization, and alternative intellectualism in the academy. Assuming some prior knowledge of the subject, we will spend a good deal of time unpacking some of the most recent scholarship and popular work concerning hip/hop and its practice. As we progress in our approach to contemporary hip/hop discourse, we will situate our inquiry around hip/hop\xE2\x80\x99s arguable utility as entertainment, as art, as social commentary, and\xE2\x80\x93perhaps most tentatively\xE2\x80\x93as a viable mode of political activism.

In the first part of the century there were Ezra Pound\xE2\x80\x99s Imagists and a range of Modernist movements, John Crowe Ransom and the southern Fugitives, and the flowerings of African American poetry both in Harlem and here in Washington, among many others. The second half of the century gave birth to the San Francisco and Beat scenes, the Black Arts Movement, the New York Schools of poets and painters, and the slam scene, to name a few more. In this class we\xE2\x80\x99ll try to read poems in the context of these social networks, seeking to recreate poetry scenes through primary materials such as manifestoes, little magazines, correspondence, recordings of poetry readings, web publications, etc."

    :description: "The relationship between poetry and politics in Northern Ireland provides the focus for our reading and studying. This relationship is complex, unpredictable and indirect. In other words, poems should not be understood to be documentary accounts of specific political events. Rather, poems reconfigure the reality of such events, redirect public energies to reflective ends and lend unsuspected significance to the historical record. How poems achieve this, and why this achievement is of particular importance in the context of the civil strife which took place in Northern Ireland from the late Sixties until very recently, forms the substance of the course\xE2\x80\x99s concerns. Authors to be studied include Seamus Heaney, Michael Longley, Paul Muldoon, Medbh McGuckian and Ciaran Carson."

  - :name: Morrison
    :number: "251"
    :description: In 1993, Toni Morrison became the eighth woman, first African American, first African American woman, and first Black woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. In its citation, the Swedish Academy praised her as one "who, in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality." This course--The Fiction of Toni Morrison--seeks to examine that "essential aspect of American reality" in Morrison's seven novels. Her works have received great acclaim, both critical and popular, because they celebrate the intricacies and complexities of human existence, in general, and Black life, specifically. Writing novels that she describes as novels she wanted to read, Morrison has chronicled African American experience from its beginnings in slavery to post-integration. Thus she has added not only to the African American literary and cultural landscape but also to the American literary and cultural landscape.

We will explore the literary and cultural contexts of their writing, a selection of their major works, and the narrative and dramatic techniques of each.

The plays that followed Look Back in Anger on the British stage were different in theme and usually in form from those that had been written and produced in the first half of the twentieth century, and they reflected not simply a new kind of theatre in Britain, but a new way of The course will consider some memorable plays by important British playwrights of the last fifty to sixty years, giving attention to theme, form, and possibilities for performance.

    :description: From its inception, film has attracted generations of artists who viewed this technology as a medium of personal and political expression. Often working within frameworks that explicitly rejected character-driven storytelling and the industrial modes of production that made narrative film so dominant, avant-garde filmmakers produced works that provide multiple answers to the question "what is cinema?" This course examines experimental filmmaking from international and historical perspectives tracing links between avant-garde film and simultaneous movements in the other arts (constructivism, expressionism, dada, surrealism, pop art, the situationists, and postmodernism). While this course assumes no previous experience in film studies, students must be prepared to welcome challenges to their conventional experience of narrative filmmaking.

Most became writers behind bars and write with care and purpose. Their poetry addresses many themes, including love, family, faith, injustice, race and ethnicity, sexual identity, poverty, prison life, war, violence, oppression, and writing itself. Students will analyze the themes, styles, and social functions of poetry by more than 50 artists. Because much of this material is out of print, many readings will be placed on electronic reserve. To deepen our appreciation for the contexts within which these poets write, we will also view several documentaries and read prose selections from various theorists, criminal justice experts, and prisoners.

Yet lyrics have served to express love(lessness), prayer, political satire, madness, desire, letters to the dead, invitations to dinner, chats with animals, and more. This course will trace the development of short poems written in English, from songs and ballads produced before Chaucer's time to those of the present day (from Beowulf to Rap).

We will also study the Romantic, Victorian, and modern changes in attitude toward the child and their implications for the creation of literature which addresses children as intellegent and perceptive readers--in some ways wiser than adults. The course takes a theoretical, historical, and "reader response" approach to the study of form, themes and issues, imagery, and narrative voice in children's literature. The 19th and early 20th century books on the syllabus are so-called classics, representing a range of genres, while the newer books (mostly Newbery Award winners) demonstrate experimental approaches to writing for children. Daily in-class writing, several short papers, and a final long research or creative project required.

But what does it mean to attach the word \xE2\x80\x9Cstudies\xE2\x80\x9D to the craft of writing? to describe the course as a \xE2\x80\x9Cseminar\xE2\x80\x9D rather than a \xE2\x80\x9Cwriting workshop\xE2\x80\x9D? If such questions arise, it is because, within the institutions where we write and study \xE2\x80\x9CEnglish,\xE2\x80\x9D we long ago accepted a simplistic and artificial distinction between the mastery of technical skills and the intellectual work of making meaning.

Framed around the reading series, the seminar encourages independent thinking and creativity with a view to exploring literary forms and practices; the work of individual authors; the relationship of writing to other arts; and the place of writing in contemporary culture. Fellows undertake an independent project (creative or critical) under the guidance of the instructor, and study and discuss the work of the year\xE2\x80\x99s scheduled guests. There are also opportunities for students to share their own writing and to participate in outreach efforts in the DC community. Enrollment in the Spring seminar is limited to the Lannan Fellows; the permission of the instructor is required. http://lannan.georgetown.edu"

    :description: "The scene is the fundamental dramatic unit in scripts designed for both the stage and the screen. This course examines model scenes from recent successful and admired scripts, offering them as patterns for the student's own writing. During the term students write increasingly complex scenes, finishing with a short original play. The course is offered in parallel to English 336 (Spring) which concentrates on the Story. These two courses can be taken in any order but together they form the prerequisite for English 337: Advanced Scriptwriting, in which the student writes a full-length original script for either stage or screen."

  - :name: American Gothic
    :number: "377"
    :description: "\"American Gothic\" inquires into the nature and purposes of civic fear. It proposes that religious terror is one of the chief influences shaping the popular culture of the United States. Theological formulas and rhetoric, although legally \xE2\x80\x9Cunspeakable,\xE2\x80\x9D are, to the contrary, spoken everywhere. Theology and fantasy are considered \xE2\x80\x9Cmarginal\xE2\x80\x9D to the day-to-day life of most Americans, yet these twin forces intersect in the private and public life of American politics and entertainment. That is, Christian theological principles -- for instance, the love of God , revelation, and apocalypse -- entimentalized, are used to create policies of social fear. For example, prohibition and taboo make possible, on the one hand, \xE2\x80\x9CDon\xE2\x80\x99t Ask Don\xE2\x80\x99t tell\xE2\x80\x9D policies of social deviancy, while on the other hand, the lure of secrets and spectacle are major features of the contemporary market of American Horror. This is the American Gothic we shall study: deviancy and taboo must be secret and hidden, yet available in book, on TV, and in News as spectacle and scandal for all. This course will explore one source for the American Gothic, beginning with the civic dreams of Puritan writers and thinkers to the nightmare theologies of Jonathan Edwards. We will then look at the inversion of this language in fantasists ike Edgar Allan Poe, HP Lovecraft, and Stephen King. We will consider, if not directly examine, the political uses of this language in speeches and in nationalist hymns and poetry from Abraham Lincoln through Ronald Reagan and beyond. Finally, we will examine various strands of contemporary American Gothic, particularly cinema work dating from the fifties forward (Night of the Living Dead, Dawn of the Dead, The Exorcist, Texas Chain Saw Massacre). We will consider popular culture and the cult of the dismembered body in films like Chain Saw Massacre and American Psycho (Bret Easton Ellis) . How does the Awe-ful -- traditionally, the experience of God -- give way to the Awful? How does the language of God and public piety give us a language of Monsters? Finally, what are monsters for in a society?"

As a matter of professional survival, public intellectuals also must develop a writing style that negotiates between high and low cultures, addressing themselves to audiences composed of educated non-specialists as well as the erudite. \xE2\x80\x9CCrossing Over\xE2\x80\x9D explores selected moments in the twentieth-century history of American cultural criticism as well as the practice of writing criticism in an accessible yet intellectually rigorous manner. Students will study critical writing and investigate its influence; they will also practice the art of critical writing in regular assignments. The course will begin by exploring the elusive and changing definitions of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe public intellectual.\xE2\x80\x9D It will then explore twentieth-century culture critics such as H.L. Mencken and the wits of the Round Table. It will then focus on the mid-century with the rise of the New York Intellectuals (Edmund Wilson, Dwight MacDonald), the early stirrings of the Women\xE2\x80\x99s Movement (Betty Friedan).

    :description: "How does English literature change as we move from oral to scribal to print culture--annd from the material to the digital text? How did the serialization of Victorian novels in periodicals affect their composition, distribution, and readership? And how is the literary history of particular eras inflected by such cultural influences as law, economics, and technology? Such questions are central to \"The History of the Book\"\xE2\x80\x94that is, the understanding of literary texts as both material artifacts and potentially disembodied (electronic) forms. This course offers students of literature an opportunity to explore some of the cultural and historical concepts behind such issues as literary authorship, forgery, piracy, translation, production, dissemination, and audience. It provides the historical foundation underlying several central debates within current literary theory, including the unstable status of the author, the gendered politics of literary publication, the economics of book distribution, the shifting definition of literary textuality, the history of literary censorship, and the legal evolution of copyright and hypertext in the Digital Age. In order to bring these issues into focus, we will read some influential literary works that stand as particular examples and illustrations within the History of the Book. In addition to landmark examples by Chaucer, Defoe, Sterne, Pope, Blake, Wordsworth, Byron, Hemans, Austen, Dickens, and the Brontes, we will also trace some of the more recent and experimental developments within literary textuality and hypertext. Theoretical readings will include essays by Foucault, Benjamin, Derrida, Borges, Habermas, Darnton, Sutherland, Eisenstein, Eaves, McGann, Woodmansee, Negroponte, Landow, Drucker, and Hayles, among others.

Through theoretical and applied readings dealing with the problem of learning in educational contexts we will engage a range of issues critical to the pedagogies of literary and cultural studies, such as close reading, interpretation and critique, complexity, ambiguity, the interplay of cognition and emotion, and the constructed nature of meaning. We will explore these and other issues in light of what we know about learning development, teaching practice, and the nature of expert thinking. In addition to readings and discussion, we will also spend significant time inquiring into real world teaching and learning contexts (including K-12, higher education, and in nontraditional academic contexts, depending on individual interests). Readings will include Sheridan Blau, James Slevin, Mariolina Salvatori, Lee Shulman, John Bransford, bell hooks, Robert Scholes, Ann Berthoff, Gerald Graff, David Perkins, Jerome Bruner, Barbara Stafford, Sam Wineburg, and others.

    :number: "512"
    :description: "In this course we will explore various modes of performance in late medieval England in light of both medieval and contemporary theories of performance, ritual, and theater. Drama itself will be a significant focus; in particular, we will seek to gain an in-depth understanding of the great Corpus Christi cycles, examining their origins, the theories of \xE2\x80\x9Cplay\xE2\x80\x9D that motivate them, their robust humor and its relation to their theological aims, their function in both supporting and contesting ideals of civic unity, the ways they seek to construct and channel emotional response, and their tendency to collapse distinctions between spectator and spectacle, elite and popular, sacred and profane. But an equally important aim of the course is to investigate the performative aspects of late-medieval English culture more generally. Thus we will consider topics such as the oral performance of lyrics, romances, and sermons; the performativity of legal language and the language of Christian ritual; participatory affective piety, including the use of holy dolls, meditative writings, and devotional objects; civic processions and public executions; dance, gesture, and body language in both sacred and secular contexts; gender performance, including cross-dressing; and conduct books and other scripts written for the performance of everyday life. Prerequisite: a genuine willingness to learn Middle English. Since all primary texts will be in the original, an initial introduction to Middle English will be followed by weekly language exercises -- both written and oral. Students can expect to emerge as adept readers and performers of this rich and musical ancestor of our common tongue."

In these fictional and non-fictional narratives, dramas, and poems, we will be particularly interested in several related concerns, processes, and themes: the construction of ideas of civilization and savagery; the working out of the dynamics of slavery/servitude and freedom (to be understood historically, economically, and politically, and also as figures for psychological and spiritual processes); and the articulation of selfhood and subjectivity in a colonial context. Additionally, we will pay some attention to the question of whether there are significant and growing differences between Old and New World identities. Although we will explore these issues during the course of our discussions, I also hope that you will become interested in topics of your own and introduce and expatiate on them during our discussions. We will study the following works: Behn\xE2\x80\x99s Oroonoko and Widow Ranter; Defoe\xE2\x80\x99s Robinson Crusoe and Colonel Jack; the captivity narrative of Mary Rowlandson; propaganda for and narratives of indentured servitude by Alsop, Moraley, and Ashbridge; Cooke\xE2\x80\x99s Sot-Weed Factor; Byrd\xE2\x80\x99s Secret History of the Dividing Line; Sarah Knight\xE2\x80\x99s Journal; Edgar Huntly, or, Memoirs of a Sleep-Walker; the autobiographies of Olaudah Equiano and Benjamin Franklin."

Starting with the premise that a historically-specific psychoanalytic approach can illuminate the complexity of class subjectivity and \xE2\x80\x9Cexperience\xE2\x80\x9D in the 19th-C (and in the present), we will begin by sampling contemporary theoretical discussions of identification, with an eye toward explicating how such accounts can help illuminate what Richard Sennett and Jonathan Cobb describe as the \xE2\x80\x9Chidden injuries of class.\xE2\x80\x9D Overall in the course, through a discussion of a variety of theoretical, historical, and literary texts, we will explore the American Dream of unencumbered class mobility as a particular formation of what critic Lauren Berlant terms \"national fantasy,\" a utopian national ideal at once deemed universally accessible and inscribed by differences of race, gender, sexuality, region, and nationality. We will examine the way 19th- and 20th-C American literary texts both reproduce, and expose the limits of and/or contradictions within, this governing ideology of \xE2\x80\x9CAmericanness\xE2\x80\x9D: we will consider the ways in which literary texts both envision the distance between utopian ideal and historical \xE2\x80\x9Creality,\xE2\x80\x9D and register the invisible psychic and social costs of subscription to this national ideal. Course readings will likely include: theoretical, historical, and critical essays by Stuart Hall, Wendy Brown, Lauren Berlant, Judith Butler, Hortense Spillers, Kaja Silverman, Anne Cheng, Carolyn Kay Steedman, Michael Rogin, Hazel Carby, Eric Lott, Claudia Tate; and literary texts by Horatio Alger, Frederick Douglass, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Maria Cummins, Harriet Wilson, Herman Melville, Frank Webb, Horatio Alger, Stephen Crane, Edith Wharton, Nella Larsen, Anzia Yezierska, and Toni Morrison."

We begin with how cinema ushered new ways of conceptualizing narrative time and space for a world ravaged by war and colonialism yet enamored by nationalisms. By the seventies, decolonization movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America offered a radically different language of cinema that also informed writings on cinema. In a final move, we will examine the new cinemas emerging from Iran and China offer yet another challenge to redefine narrative time and space.

    :description: "What is postmodernism? Is it a historical moment that emerges from modernity? Is it a different notion of history itself from that of modernist intellectual work? Is it a set of texts and objects, or a significant change in the ways we discuss such things? Does postmodernism describe a renewed critique of the political economy of capitalism, and its related cultural production? This course is an examination of the meanings of the postmodern in its various approaches. The course emerges from the practices of critical theory and cultural studies, and asks questions about who are the subjects of postmodernism's discourses: for whom is the postmodern a theory of what has happened in the moment of late capitalism? How do theories of the postmodern define the social practices of power and language which define (but do not entirely delimit) us in this historical moment? Do contemporary media reflect the shifts in zeitgeist that critics of the postmodern claim, or perhaps do we simply live in the full realization of modernism's projects? The course begins with questions of what defines modernism, as it emerges in 19th century European philosophy, politics and aesthetics, and then becomes the full-scaled critical and artistic blossoming of the industrial west in the 20th century. The syllabus then moves to those projects that attempt to historicize postmodernism in distinction to modernism, whereupon we take up critical projects which have emerged more recently in relation to current global political events and the phenomenon of globalization itself.

  - :name: Hip_Hop As Public Culture
    :number: "740"
    :description: Particularly since the early 1990s, we have seen a proliferation of fine art, literature, and scholarship that has furthered the establishment of hip_hop studies in what might be called unlikely venues. In the past few years especially, we have witnessed the development of university courses, academic conferences, museum exhibits, and collaborative research initiatives devoted to an investigation of the culture and its practice. Embedded in the discourse around hip_hop as an intellectual project is an ongoing argument about exactly how we should be arguing about hip_hop and about how we should interpret its prominence as a topic in critical circles. The current discussion engages hip_hop at the line of transition, in a moment of crisis in public culture and cultural studies. The turn of the millennium witnesses hip_hop being mediated by big industry and marketed globally to an unprecedented extreme. A new core group of entities and individuals is deciding for us what hi p_hop is and what hip_hop means. To the extent that hip_hop is referenced synonymously with black culture, we also see particular conceptions of blackness being mediated and marketed as well. And we are challenged to remark upon the ways in which what have been until now relatively privately constructed subjectivities are being regulated in nontraditional spaces. There is a new level of public access to the agency of identity. It is impossible to have a comprehensive discussion about race or Americanness, about class or gender or sexuality, without incorporating a principled discussion of the state of and ramifications of hip_hop culture today. And the character and content of its appropriation and commodification make the current condition of the text a veritable human rights concern. Hip_hop and conversations around hip_hop almost necessarily compromise the boundaries of private and public expressive spheres, challenging us as critical thinkers to account for the cons istent evidence of alternative intellectualisms and revised epistemologies. The work facilitates a dialogue through which parameters of nationalist community and cultural authenticity are defined and readjusted constantly. In this seminar we will spend a good deal of time unpacking some of the most recent scholarship and popular work concerning hip_hop and its practice. And we will produce our own potentially publishable contributions to the contemporary discourse.

    :number: "744"
    :description: "We will looks at works from throughout the silent period, with particular attention given to American silents. Feature-length films will include: Nanook of the North (Robert Flaherty 1922) Sherlock Jr. (Buster Keaton 1924) The Iron Horse (John Ford 1924) Pandora\xE2\x80\x99s Box (G.W. Pabst 1929) The Smiling Madame Beudet (Germaine Dulac 1922) The Blot (Lois Weber 1921) The Crowd (King Vidor 1928) Sunrise (F.W. Murnau 1927) The Jazz Singer (Alan Crosland 1927) We will consider the importance of various factors on silent film production including audience demographics, picture palaces, technological developments and the Hollywood production system. We will explore the contours of what it meant to be a \xE2\x80\x9Cstar\xE2\x80\x9D (Louise Brooks and Rudolph Valentino will be our case studies) and what it meant to look and to be looked at. We will examine the cultural and political ramifications of different silent film genres such as the documentary, the western, comedy and melodrama. We will explore how cinema created and responded to cultural myths \xE2\x80\x93 in particular, myths of America, of race and of gender. We will closely analyze components of the films from shots and POV to editing and score. Each film will be accompanied by readings that further elucidate the film, its director, or its genre and by primary source readings that address issues contemporary to the film. For example, when we watch a western, we will also read Theodore Roosevelt\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CThe Strenuous Life.\xE2\x80\x9D In addition to class participation, requirements for this seminar include weekly written responses and the preparation of a final conference paper, which will include an abstract, an oral presentation and a final written paper."

  - :name: Medieval Sexualities
    :number: "104"
    :description: This four-credit course aims to better understand the variety of medieval sexualities from a comparative sampling of social institutions and writings. We will study depictions of sexualities and gender issues in various European literatures, classical and medieval biological and medical texts, religious thought and law, and the cultural variation present across the religions, regions and periods from c. 500-1500. Students might expect, for example, to learn more of Anglo-Saxon attitudes from penitentials, to think about the implications of Irish laws on divorce, to read courtly literature through the lens of contemporary medical knowledge, to weigh the impact of clashing cultural attitudes, or to consider the connections between prosecution of heresies and accusations of deviancy. You will be expected to work on smaller papers during the term, building up your understanding and learning to research sources in this field, culminating in a longer, final written project on a topic of your choice, developed in consultation with the professor.

Students will read the work in original Middle English in which Chaucer wrote it, and discuss it in small and in large groups, focusing upon the work's narrative strategies, intellectual constructions, and artistic accomplishment. They will also write, in a variety of ways, about those aspects which particularly take their interest. Fall 2005 Only Professor McNamer In this course we will undertake a critical study of that brilliant masterpiece, The Canterbury Tales. By turns bawdy and lofty, racy and religious, hilarious and deeply moving, this collection of stories will challenge us to develop ways of reading adequate to its double status as relic of the distant past and as a text that anticipates many contemporary understandings of identity, meaning, and truth. We will read the Tales in the original Middle English, which is really quite easy; no prior exposure to the language is necessary.

  - :name: Medieval Lyric Poetry
    :number: "116"
    :description: "This course offers a broad survey of the medieval lyric through the lens of cultural studies. We will take a pan-European view of the genre, reading not only lyrics from medieval England, Ireland, Provence, Portugal, Germany, and Italy, but from the rich Arabic and Hebrew traditions of Andalusia. Most of these lyrics are gorgeous, even at first glance; many also come across as powerful expressions of personal emotion that transcend culture, politics, and history. But our object in this course will be to recall that, however beautiful they may be, \xE2\x80\x9Ctexts are worldly\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 and thus to embed the poems in the historical, cultural and theoretical matrices that can illuminate their ideological operations as well as (and in conjunction with) their aesthetic complexities. Theorists such as Althusser, Jauss, Bourdieu, Butler, Foucault, Said, Zizek and Schechner will guide us we investigate, among other things, the function of the lyric in the production of subjectivity (including gender and sexuality), social relations, religious identities and cultural allegiances. Given the lyric\xE2\x80\x99s preoccupation with emotion \xE2\x80\x93 from the intense grief voiced in Marian laments to the erotic yearnings of troubadour song \xE2\x80\x93 our discussions will often center on the historicity of feeling: on how emotion is constructed and performed via the lyric, and to what social and political ends. Cultural transmission will be another focus, as we move from considering the interactions between \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Clow\xE2\x80\x9D cultures in the production and performance of the lyric to an extended investigation of convivencia among Muslims, Jews and Christians in medieval Spain \xE2\x80\x93 a \xE2\x80\x9Cculture of tolerance\xE2\x80\x9D created and sustained in part through the vehicle of lyric poetry.

    :number: "140"
    :description: "This course cultivates an understanding of Shakespeare's skill as a poet-dramatist and introduces one to the range and caliber of Shakespeare's plays in the three genres in which he wrote--comedy, history, and tragedy--spanning his approximately twenty-three years as a professional playwright in Elizabethan London. Six well-known plays from different stages of his career provide representative examples of his work: Romeo and Juliet, The Merchant of Venice, Henry IV: Part One, Hamlet, Othello, and The Tempest. We will also read and see the Lansburgh theatrical production of The Two Gentlemen of Verona. If you have previously read one or more of these plays, so much the better. What you discover is how much more there is to discover upon each re-experience of the play. We will explore various aspects of Shakespearean dramaturgy--characterization, theme, dramatic structure, language, and plot--as well as sources and influences on his work; the main emphasis will be on the plays themselves as texts for the theater, reflecting Shakespeare's versatility and artistic habits. Why has this young, small-town, middle-class man, with no college education, not only succeeded in his own era as an actor/playwright for a popular audience that included every sector of society, but also transcended four centuries to become a literary giant in British and American cultures and whose reputation has circled the globe? Both lecture and discussion methods will be employed with the primary emphasis on sustained discussion and student in-class presentations. In addition to required films and theatrical productions, students will complete a series of analytical and creative writing assignments, at least six short essays and two long essays."

    :description: "At first glance, the idea and importance of crossing boundaries is, perhaps, not immediately apparent in the eighteenth century but its presence is certainly felt in this period\xE2\x80\x99s prose fiction. Daniel Defoe\xE2\x80\x99s Robinson Crusoe and Jonathan Swift\xE2\x80\x99s Gulliver\xE2\x80\x99s Travels both convey a sense of exploration and colonial expansion outside British national borders; Maria Edgeworth\xE2\x80\x99s Belinda highlights Britons\xE2\x80\x99 concern about racial mixing in England; Isaac Bickerstaffe\xE2\x80\x99s thinly veiled transvestite, Miss Molly, appears in Love in the City, and Mary Hays\xE2\x80\x99 The Victim of Prejudice tackles, as its subject, the life of a woman who oversteps contemporary mores of female respectability and conduct. These examples illustrate the fact that British writers are interested in characters that cross racial, sexual, gender and national boundaries, and their texts highlight the problems and possibilities that such acts of transgression generate. This course looks closely at an assortment of characters that transgress margins\xE2\x80\x94figures such as the pirate, the mulatto heiress, the prostitute, the kept lady, the sailor, the transvestite, the female cross-dresser, and the fugitive slave as they are represented primarily, but not exclusively, in eighteenth-century prose fiction. With a focus on travel literature, drama, slave narratives, short stories, novels and marine/ maritime literature, some relatively famous, others quite obscure, we will look at occasions where these figures are either in the service of, or in opposition to, a British Imperial project that sought to restrict, enclose, and define the borders of individuality as well as space. Some of the texts that we will encounter: The Woman of Colour, Janet Schaw\xE2\x80\x99s Journal of a Lady of Quality, Olaudah Equiano\xE2\x80\x99s Interesting Narrative, Lucy Peacock\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9CThe Creole\xE2\x80\x9D and Samuel Jackson Pratt\xE2\x80\x99s The New Cosmetic, Daniel Defoe\xE2\x80\x99s Moll Flanders, Oroonokos by Thomas Southerne and John Hawkesworth, John Thomas Haines The Ocean of Life, Isaac Bickerstaffe\xE2\x80\x99s Love in the City and Amelia Opie\xE2\x80\x99s Adeline Mowbray."

    :description: How did slavery became a part of the European literary landscape? How did European writers go about convincing Britons to accept ideas as radical as slave revolution and the abolition of the slave trade? These are just some of the questions we will consider in this course as we examine all types of literature from the period associated with rise of both slavery and abolition in the British Empire between 1660 and 1831. Our aim will be to look at the various ways European writers framed and presented these issues as well as how their work grew to be almost a national obsession in Britain, complicating issues surrounding marriage, gender roles, race, sexuality, ethics and national identity. Texts will include poetry, prose and drama published in Britain but written by a host of European and American writers including Heinrich von Kleist, Maria Edgeworth, Mary Astell, Aphra Behn, John Ferriar, Claire de Duras, Olaudah Equiano and Royall Tyler

    :description: Queer Pre-histories. The course will focus on representations of dissident sexuality in 19th century US literature. Reading both canonical and popular literature, we will analyze the escalating importance of sexuality in the American cultural and political imagination. We will evaluate overlapping discourses of eroticism, morality, and public health as they shape representations of sex and sexuality, and will also devote particular attention to the part played by the sexual body in evolving constructions of race and gender, in emergent class identities, and in nineteenth-century political conflicts. Part of our purpose will be to examine the way that representations of sexuality in these texts prefigure the division of sexuality into an opposition between 'homosexuality' and 'heterosexuality'; however, we will also address the forms taken by sexuality beyond this binary division.

We will especially consider how technological advancements in the manufacturing and understanding of sight and images influenced a host of American literary genres and thereby impacted broader concerns involving the formation of U.S. national and, specifically, racial politics. To this end, we will examine the role of eyewitness observation, and scenes of artistic and sartorial spectacularity in travel narratives, novels, children\xE2\x80\x99s geography textbooks, and abolitionist propaganda.

  - :name: "19th Century American Fiction: Class/Labor"
    :number: "189"
    :description: "As several recent critics have noted, class remains an under-studied cultural category in nineteenth-century U. S. literature. In this course, we will examine how a diverse group of nineteenth century American authors imagined and constructed class relations in their literary works, exploring the ways in which class as literary, discursive construction is shaped by and entangled with discourses of gender, race, ethnicity, sexuality, region, and nation. We will pay special attention to nineteenth century literary responses to urbanization, industrialization, and the growing gap between rich and poor, and the ways in which these economic and social developments pressured the utopian national ideology of the \"American Dream\"--a dominant expression of U. S. national fantasy and the \"juncture,\" in the words of critic Lauren Berlant, where \"the unconscious meets history.\" Topics covered will include: the relationship between the literature of domesticity and middle-class formation; the mutually-constitutive relationship between race and class, and the racial ambivalences of white and black working-class texts, during this era; the complex relationship between abolitionism and working-class radicalism; the often-ignored historical and cultural presence of the black middle class during the slavery era; the racialization (and feminization) of poverty, \"service\" and various forms of \"unfree labor\" throughout the century; the entanglement of class and sex in depictions of women workers; the shifting political and literary priorities in the postbellum, especially post-Reconstruction era, which accompanied the literary \"discovery\" of (and investment in) class over race as national preoccupation; and historically-changing understandings of writing as a form of (literary) labor. We will read texts by a range of nineteenth-century authors, including Lydia Maria Child, George Foster, Frank Webb, Harriet Wilson, Frederick Douglass, Seth Luther, Sarah Bagley and various contributors to the Lowell Offering, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Anzia Yezierska, Emma Lazarus, Pauline Hopkins, Stephen Crane, Jacob Riis, and Edith Wharton; we will also read a number of historical, critical, and theoretical texts about class. Course requirements will include a group presentation, short written responses to each week\xE2\x80\x99s readings, and two essays (a 5-page essay early in the term and a final, 10-12 page essay)."

    :description: "As the twentieth century began, a new literary form emerged, a kind of urban poetry constructed out of images of gals, guts, guns, and gumshoes with a drinking problem and a fondness for chivalric myth. This course explores the evolution of American hard-boiled detective fiction and the larger mysteries lurking in, (to use Raymond Chandler\xE2\x80\x99s immortal phrase) \xE2\x80\x9Ca world gone wrong.\xE2\x80\x9D Beginning with the \xE2\x80\x9Curban shock\xE2\x80\x9D tales of Edgar Allan Poe and proceeding into the Golden Age British mystery tradition, this course goes on to discuss pulp fiction detective stories of the teens and twenties. Hard boiled detective fiction begins in earnest with the short stories of Dashiell Hammett and his classic novel, The Maltese Falcon. Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald--the other two members of The Holy Trinity of Crime Fiction--are represented by The Big Sleep and Black Money, respectively. Other hard-boiled writers whose work will be covered include: James M. Cain, Mickey Spillane, Robert B. Parker, Sara Paretsky, and Richard Stevenson. In addition, we will discuss highlights of the complementary tradition of film noir, including the classic films: \xE2\x80\x9CDouble Indemnity,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CThe Maltese Falcon,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CMildred Pierce,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9CThe Big Heat\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CA Touch of Evil.\xE2\x80\x9D"

    :description: "This course aims to develop languages for analyzing the role of class in U. S. women's lives, languages sensitive to the complex interrelations of race, sexuality, ethnicity, gender, region, and class. Because of the general cultural and political invisibility of poor and working class women in contemporary America, we will pay special attention to the experiences and voices of poor and working class women; at the same time, we will explore our own class positions and experiences, reminding ourselves that all of us--not just poor and working class women--have class identities. As part of our analysis, we will discuss the role of class in education (including higher education), and the ways in which schools can serve to produce and reproduce the social relations of class. While we will look back to key historical moments of the last century (especially the 1930s, a period of intense capitalist crisis and labor activism), our emphasis will be on the contemporary moment: the gendered and racialized class relations of the so-called \"new economy,\" and the necessity of situating U. S. class relations within a global context. In pursuing our analysis, we will consider the respective historical blindnesses of both labor and feminist activism: the traditional masculinism of the labor movement (continued within the New Left), as well as the often-insufficient attention to class differences in feminist theory and practice. Course materials will include cultural productions--literary texts, media productions, and popular music--by poor and working class women, as well as historical, sociological, and theoretical analyses of class in the U.

    :description: "In 1925, Alain Locke described the emergence of a generation of black artists and intellectuals who would represent the marginalized \xE2\x80\x9Cfolk\xE2\x80\x9D in the United States and who would serve as a bridge into the possibility of equitable American citizenship. This \xE2\x80\x9CNew Negro\xE2\x80\x9D was characterized as a cultural vanguard responsible for the leadership not only of the African American community but also of oppressed people of color across the planet. In this course we will approach the Harlem Renaissance as a nexus of black cosmopolitanism beginning with an analysis of some of its central literary texts and crossing media to examine some of the visual and popular work of the creative period. While unpacking the prose and poetry of Langston Hughes, Nella Larsen, Claude McKay, and other integral figures, we will trace the conceptualization of Harlem itself as a virtual \xE2\x80\x9Crace capital,\xE2\x80\x9D and we will deal with several more contemporary representations of the aesthetic movement, its political ramifications, and its primary operative space. Considering recent critical disputes about the relative success or failure of this \xE2\x80\x9CHarlem Renaissance,\xE2\x80\x9D we will explore the limitations of this nomenclature. Through a series of readings, discussions, and essay assignments we will address the recurring themes of the movement with a particular focus on transnational mobility and transcultural exchange. We will investigate the location of black cultural production as it is simultaneously equated with and placed in opposition to conventional notions of Americanness\xE2\x80\x93-a context in which the New Negro is realized as both producer and product, commodifier and commodified body."

    :description: In this era of transnationalism, Asian Americans' connections to Asia have been imagined to be particularly valuable to a larger understanding of "Asian" culture. In an effort to tease out the new conceptualizations of Asia and Asian Americans, this course will focus on representations of Asia by Asian diasporic writers in the Americas. Even though many of the writers we will be reading are second and third generation Asian Americans or Asian Canadians, their "memories" of Asia are thought to offer a presumably "authentic" representation of Asia to U.S. and Canadian audiences. How are these writers imagining Asia, and how do their depictions offer new ways of analyzing how Asia, the United States, Canada, and Asian American/Canadian identities are constructed? Reading works set in China, Korea, Japan, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam, as well as theories of post-colonialism, race, and transnationalism, we will explore, problematize, critique, and analyze the relationship between Asian diasporic writing and Asia.

In this course we will discuss what is conventionally and conveniently called \xE2\x80\x9Cscience fiction,\xE2\x80\x9C and we will explore the relative limitations of this nomenclature as black writers, artists, and intellectuals conceptualize a radical politics of representation through an approach to cultural production that traditionally has been considered \xE2\x80\x9Cwhite.\xE2\x80\x9D Considering that identity and agency are inevitably mediated through a shifting conjunction of race, class, gender, sexuality, and nationality, it is important that we take an accurate measure of the extent to which what we understand to be reality is informed by ruptures in and modifications of this media. Over this term we will discuss a range of speculative text, including but certainly not limited to novels by George Schuyler, Octavia Butler, Samuel Delany, and Nalo Hopkinson; films by Melvin Van Peebles and Haile Gerima; and music by Sun Ra, Prince, and MF Doom. We will think through the ways in which blackness in particular is constructed and reconfigured as these cultural workers theorize new modes of critical resistance. We will investigate the ways in which alternative histories and presents are imagined through the production of various futures."

We will read widely in medieval works from Irish, Finnish, Old English, Middle English, Icelandic and French contexts, and examine Tolkien\xE2\x80\x99s biography, letters, critical and scholarly publications, and lesser known fictional works, all to get a better sense of what Tolkien knew and worked with as he wrote. We will read some of his scholarship, poetry, translations, draft work and unfinished pieces as well as the major works, The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings. Our interest focuses on Tolkien as writer and scholar. The culmination of our contextual study will be over five weeks spent on re-reading The Lord of the Rings. Students can expect to research and report on extensive supplementary topics on Blackboard, keep a regular journal, write a paper and finish with a substantial take-home exam. PREREQUISITE: You must have read the complete Lord of the Rings before the course starts. The text is simply too large (in all ways) for anyone who does not know it reasonably well to take this class, given the additional reading. I will be administering a test on the first day to ensure that you have read the book. Anyone who has not read the text at least once, as evidenced by the test, will be dropped from the course.

The course will emphasize, for example: socio-cultural relationships between the literary, the vernacular, and the \xE2\x80\x9Cfolk\xE2\x80\x9D; interdisciplinary connections between music, writing, and other forms of popular culture; the critical presence of intertexuality and \xE2\x80\x9Csignification\xE2\x80\x9D; the interplay of \xE2\x80\x9Cmodernism\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cpostmodernism\xE2\x80\x9D; the construction of \xE2\x80\x9Crace\xE2\x80\x9D and cultural expectations and values; the tropes and themes that emerge throughout Ellison\xE2\x80\x99s work; Ellison\xE2\x80\x99s presence as a philosopher and as a public intellectual dedicated to the craft of writing (the novel, essays, short stories). Related to each of these elements is Ellison\xE2\x80\x99s constant meditation on what it means to be both an (African) American artist and a writer in the world at large."

    :number: "261"
    :description: "In this class we'll examine the writing lives of selected 20th century women poets who played significant roles in shaping the literary fields in which they worked, especially poets who doubled as editors, critics, publishers, and scene-makers. We will read closely the careers of four major figures--Marianne Moore, Gwendolyn Brooks, Margaret Walker, and Adrienne Rich. We'll also broaden our sense of both literature and literary history by studying women's networks--from the salons of Paris' Left Bank in the early part of the century, to Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez' negotiations of race and sex in the 1960s, to contemporary women poets across a range of identities and aesthetics. We will have rich connections to explore during the two periods in which women wielded the most power within the poetic field: Modernism (1910-30), and the re-emergence of women's poetic communities as second wave feminism made its mark in the 70s and 80s."

    :description: The Man Booker Prize, Britain's most prestigious literary award for fiction, has caught the attention and imagination of the international English-reading public. Controversy frequently occurs over the books selected annually as the competition finalists, as well as over the eventual winning novel which is announced at an award ceremony in London broadcast live on national television. This year's seminar will read, discuss, and judge the six novels shortlisted for 2003; follow the progress of and participate in the 2005 competition as it unfolds; and conclude with reading some past winners that have become classics. Members of the seminar will be expected to investigate the nomination process, monitor the public press coverage of the award, and analyze the cultural and commercial as well as the literary influences and consequences of the forces operating on authors, sponsors, and judges.

    :description: "What is a black film? What is its function? In this course we will examine films made by and/or about black Americans over the last one hundred years as we attempt to determine the potential commonalities of style, narrative trope, and production method that could distinguish these works as a specifically marked and marketed body of cinema. As we approach these films, we will more deliberately be using this selection of texts as a space for the critique of the ways that blackness and Americanness are represented in public media. We will address some of the challenges and apparent disparities that exist between image culture and economic culture, between aesthetic culture and political culture, as African American writers, directors, and actors variously render resistance to and acquiescence to restrictive conventions of race, class, gender, and nationality. Moving from D.W. Griffith\xE2\x80\x99s The Birth of a Nation through to Spike Lee\xE2\x80\x99s Bamboozled, we will conduct a mostly chronological survey of feature-length films and read a smattering of critical work that directly and indirectly speaks to the central texts. Through a series of conversations and essay assignments we will build our own discourse around a theorization of \xE2\x80\x9Cblack film\xE2\x80\x9D and around the question of whether such a designation is useful to a particular received agenda. We will flesh out some substantive ideas about what \xE2\x80\x9CAfrican American cinema\xE2\x80\x9D indicates concerning the agency of production and representation for marginalized people. And we will chart the increasing significance of this discussion in an era of globalized technology and contemporary policy shifts that inform the ways that black bodies are constructed and commodified on a very big screen."

    :description: This course examines our fascination with haunted houses, monstrous beasts, and mutilated bodies that populate horror films. However petrified we are after a showing of the most recent 'scariest movie,' we return to the theater for yet another visceral experience. The course suggests that a historical exploration of such films will lead us to consider how our fascination with horror films may lie in the manner in which they stage some of the most uncomfortable social and political antagonisms. Looking at a wide array of horror films, the course will also examine how the genre has had a profound influence on film theory, especially in shaping questions of spectatorship. Requirements for the course include film viewings, pop quizzes, and written assignments.

In the twentieth century, a number of American writers, both Black and White, have written novels that engage the institution of slavery. What types of cultural work do these revisions of slavery perform? How do memory and history function in the American literary imagination? Our readings and discussions will focus on two emancipatory (commonly known as slave)narratives and several novels about slavery by African American writers. Additionally, we will read a number of novels by Anglo-American writers. Writers may include Frederick Douglass, Toni Morrison, Willa Cather and Valerie Martin. We will consider the following questions: what are some of the reasons for revisiting slavery in literature; how does the imagination augment our understanding of the past; why does slavery continue to haunt contemporary society; and what function does the contemporary narrative serve for its readers? This course is reading and writing intensive. Students may expect several short essays, a midterm, and a final research paper."

While the theoretical speculations have taken American and European films as their models, they seem totally unprepared for the vibrant horror films emerging from Asia, India to Japan, and this is exactly our charge for the course\xE2\x80\x94to better understand the cinematic style of Asian horror films. As any cinephile would testify while these films have the stock figures of ghosts and monsters, haunted houses and possessed women, they also question our settled ideas of beauty and disgust that imperceptibly shape our notions of racial, sexual, and national differences."

    :number: "314"
    :description: "Comics is unique form of art that integrates (and is dependent on) both visual and verbal modes of communication. It also closely interacts with other art forms and cultural practices, such as film, theater, literature, paintings, photography, television, and radio. This course explores some of the key works of story comics, or graphic novels, from diverse cultural backgrounds and historical periods. Our goals are twofold: we will seek to gain greater understanding of these works through close analysis and contextualization; we will also use comics/ graphic novels as sites of investigation for theories of film, performance, visual art, and literary criticism. Because of its nature as an interdisciplinary and intertextual art form that often borrows vocabularies from other arts, comics present an ideal ground for such experimental theoretical application. The definition of the term \xE2\x80\x9Cgraphic novel\xE2\x80\x9D is a topic of scholarly debate in itself. For the purpose of this course, we will use the following working definition: \xE2\x80\x9Ccomics that have sustained (novel-like) plots that do not necessarily rely on humor.\xE2\x80\x9D Each week, we will read a graphic novel, paired with theoretical readings from diverse disciplines in humanities, including film studies, performance studies, literary criticism, and cultural studies. This course does not attempt to cover \xE2\x80\x9Cthe history of comics,\xE2\x80\x9D or to discuss all the \xE2\x80\x9Cmasterworks\xE2\x80\x9D of comics of great historical importance. The works were chosen based on their craft, topical interest, critical attention they have received (though in varying degrees), and compatibility with the theoretical framework. Titles introduced in the course include (but are not limited to): Will Eisner, The Contract With God, Alan Moore, Watchmen, Marjane Satrapi, Persepolis: A Story of a Childhood, Art Spiegelman, MAUS, and Osamu Tezuka, Phoenix The Chapter of the Future."

Beginning by analyzing its roots in Shakespearean drama, we will study its full emergence in Restoration drama, and its recreation in the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Topics will include the comparative study of the traits detectable in the comedies of manners of each period, putting emphasis on their thematic and structural analogies and differences. Texts will include William Shakespeare, Much Ado About Nothing (1599); William Congreve, The Way of the World (1700); Richard Sheridan, The School for Scandal (1777); Oscar Wilde, The Importance of Being Earnest (1895); George Bernard Shaw, Pygmalion (1913); Noel Coward, Hay Fever (1925).

    :description: Beginning with fairy tales and Alice in Wonderland, we will look at some of the major novels, picture books, and fantasies written for the child (in English) for the last two centuries, examining them as serious works of literary art and cultural formation. We will also study the Romantic, Victorian, and modern changes in attitude toward the child and their implications for the creation of literature which addresses children as intellegent and perceptive readers--in some ways wiser than adults. The course takes a theoretical, historical, and "reader response" approach to the study of form, themes and issues, imagery, and narrative voice in children's literature. The 19th and early 20th century books on the syllabus are so-called classics, representing a range of genres, while the newer books (mostly Newbery Award winners) demonstrate experimental approaches to writing for children. Daily in-class writing, several short papers, and a final long research or creative project required. The class will be conducted as a discussion and all students will be responsible for contributing.

Our investigation of this contemporary cultural identity will also be informed by, and grounded in, the black presence in British literature that preceded World War II. Beginning with Shakespeare\xE2\x80\x99s Othello, we will map out a historical and political trajectory of the black presence in British literature prior to 1945. In this way, the course will explore the changes black representations go through in British culture from the 17th to the 21st centuries to determine how heavily the twentieth century \xE2\x80\x98black British\xE2\x80\x99 cultural identity has its roots in political struggles and literary representations of the past.

How is literature affected when we consider, say, Thackeray\xE2\x80\x99s coded emphasis on particular illustrations, Joyce\xE2\x80\x99s preoccupation with pagination, or Emily Dickinson\xE2\x80\x99s use of stationery and paper scraps? How did the serialization of Dickens\xE2\x80\x99s novels in periodicals affect their composition, distribution, and readership? And how is the literary history of particular eras inflected by such cultural influences as law, economics, and technology? Such questions are central to \"Technologies of the Text\"\xE2\x80\x94t hat is, the understanding of (literary) texts as both material artifacts and potentially disembodied (electronic) forms. This technological aspect of the class\xE2\x80\x94its concern with production, dissemination, and materiality\xE2\x80\x94will also enable us to ask the following questions: How has digital culture and technology altered our concepts of the author, the reader, and the interaction between the two? How do texts and readers change with the advent of the printing press, machine-made paper, linotype machines, and steam-powered presses\xE2\x80\x94as well as with the invention of the woodcut, photography, movies, the e-book, and even the online (interactive) video game? This course also offers students of literature an opportunity to explore some of the cultural and historical concepts behind such topics as authorship, forgery, plagiarism, piracy, translation, (re)production, dissemination, library culture, and the history of reading. We will also discuss such fields as information technology, electronic communication, internet architecture, textual theory, and the science of knowledge. Many of these issues will offer digital and literary analogues. In the literary context, we will discuss the historical foundation underlying several central debates within current literary theory, including the unstable status of the author, the gendered politics of literary publication, the economics of book distribution, the shifting definition of literary textuality, the history of literary censorship, and the legal evolution of copyright in the Digital Age. In the electronic context, we will discuss theories of hypertext, weblog journals, and online novels. Theoretical readings will include essays by Benjamin, Borges, Chartier, Darnton, Derrida, Drucker, Eaves, Eisenstein, Foucault, Habermas, Hayles, Jackson, Landow, McGann, Negroponte, Stallybrass, Sutherland, and Woodmansee, among others. In order to bring the foregoing issues into focus, we will also read some influential literary works that stand as particular examples and illustrations within the field of textual history and theory. In addition to landmark examples by Chaucer, Defoe, Sterne, Pope, Blake, Wordsworth, Byron, Hemans, Austen, Dickens,the Brontes, and Joyce, we will also trace some of the more recent, experimental developments within literary and electronic textuality.

We will read Chaucer in the original Middle English, which is really quite easy; plenty of coaching and language exercises will be provided early in the semester. Our largest goal is to assess the value and the limitations of contemporary theories and methods as tools for reading literature from a distinctly distant past. The course may thus prove useful for the study of other pre-twentieth-century literatures and cultures. No previous exposure to Middle English or to critical theory is required. Written work will consist of short (5-7 p) papers during the term rather than one long paper at the end.

    :number: "516"
    :description: "This course provides an introduction to the methods of medieval cultural studies, the loosely-affiliated set of practices inspired in part by contemporary cultural studies and postmodern theory. It will do so not by presenting these approaches in isolation, but by bringing them to bear on a single, polymorphic genre: the medieval lyric. We will take a pan-European view of the genre, reading not only lyrics from medieval England, Ireland, Provence, Portugal, Germany, and Italy, but from the rich Arabic and Hebrew traditions of Andalusia. Most of these lyrics are gorgeous, even at first glance; many also come across as powerful expressions of personal emotion that transcend culture, politics, and history. But our object in this course will be to recall that, however beautiful they may be, \xE2\x80\x9Ctexts are worldly\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 and thus to embed the poems in the historical, cultural and theoretical matrices that can illuminate their ideological operations as well as (and in conjunction with) their aesthetic complexities. Theorists such as Althusser, Jauss, Bourdieu, Butler, Foucault, Said, Zizek and Schechner will guide us we investigate, among other things, the function of the lyric in the production of subjectivity (including gender and sexuality), social relations, religious identities and cultural allegiances. Given the lyric\xE2\x80\x99s preoccupation with emotion \xE2\x80\x93 from the intense grief voiced in Marian laments to the erotic yearnings of troubadour song \xE2\x80\x93 our discussions will often center on the historicity of feeling: on how emotion is constructed and performed via the lyric, and to what social and political ends. Cultural transmission will be another focus, as we move from considering the interactions between \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Clow\xE2\x80\x9D cultures in the production and performance of the lyric to an extended investigation of the convivencia among Muslims, Jews and Christians in medieval Spain \xE2\x80\x93 a \xE2\x80\x9Cculture of tolerance\xE2\x80\x9D created and sustained in part through the vehicle of lyric poetry.

Many scholars have considered the conceptualization of race as an early modern phenomenon, but an examination of medieval texts and scholarship reveals that a racial discourse is already being articulated in the thirteenth century. We will therefore consider the scholarship of this earlier period to see how the intersections of race, gender and religion are represented, before turning to the early modern engagement with and development upon these ideas. Our focus will be on Islam and Judaism as the primary sites of the intersection of religious and racial alterity, noting gender differences in the representations of these faith groups.

Topics covered will include: the relationship between the literature of domesticity and middle-class formation; nineteenth century literary responses to urbanization, industrialization, and the growing gap between rich and poor; the constitutive relationship between race and class and the racial ambivalences of white and black working-class literature during this era; the complex relationship between abolitionism and working-class radicalism; the often-ignored cultural presence of the black middle class during the slavery era; the racialization of \"service\" and various forms of \"unfree labor\" throughout the century; the entanglement of class and sex in depictions of women workers; and the shifting political and literary priorities in the postbellum, especially post-Reconstruction era, which accompanied the literary \"discovery\" of (and investment in) class over race as national preoccupation. We will read texts by a range of nineteenth-century authors, including Maria Cummins, Lydia Maria Child, George Foster, Frank Webb, Harriet Wilson, Frederick Douglass, Seth Luther, Sarah Bagley and various contributors to the Lowell Offering, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Elizabeth Stuart Phelps, Anzia Yezierska, Emma Lazarus, Stephen Crane, Jacob Riis, and Edith Wharton. In addition, we will read critical and historical texts by such scholars as Nancy Armstrong, Carolyn Kay Steedman, Lauren Berlant, Wendy Brown, Laura Wexler, Amy Kaplan, Eric Lott, Peter Stallybrass and Allon White, Frank Mort, Kathy Peiss, Christine Stansell, Laura Kipnis, and Amy Schrager Lang. Course requirements will include an oral presentation, short written responses to each week\xE2\x80\x99s readings, and two essays (a 5-page essay early in the term and a final, seminar-length essay)."

  - :name: Victorian Sexualities
    :number: "592"
    :description: "Recent criticism of the literature and culture of the middle and late nineteenth century has pointed out that the famous Victorian prudery meant not so much that people stopped talking and writing about sex and sexuality but that people talked and wrote about it more\xE2\x80\x94if only to describe precisely what it was that people weren\xE2\x80\x99t supposed to be thinking about. In this course, we will examine the different ways that Victorian fiction and non-fiction prose addressed the many questions of sexual transgression that arose in the period, including divorce, adultery, bigamy, homosexuality, and prostitution. It will focus on the Victorian novel, exploring how central sexual and erotic cross-currents are to the development of the canonical novel itself, but alongside the novels we will also be reading from a wide selection of other prose genres, from the short story to the newspaper expos\xC3\xA9 to the diary to the case study. Throughout the entire course, we will devote particular attention to the ways that the prose of the period relates sexual transgression to such other questions as gender roles, national identity, the class structure, religion, and literary history. Authors will include Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Oscar Wilde, Walter Pater, Henry James, Christina Rossetti, Sheridan Le Fanu, Bram Stoker, Michael Field, Sarah Grand, Havelock Ellis, and Sigmund Freud; theoretical and historical accounts may include works by Foucault, Sedgwick, Sinfield, Halperin, Dowling, Kincaid, Kendrick, Walkowitz, and Showalter."

We will be concerned broadly with the meaning for this poetry of British colonization, the Atlantic slave trade and the plantation system; and more specifically with various problems pertaining to language, culture, tradition, race & gender as articulated by the poets themselves and in recent literary criticism and cultural theory. Readings will include texts in translation, notably from the work of Aim\xC3\xA9 C\xC3\xA9saire, other poets of Negritude, and their allies such as Claude McKay and Langston Hughes, to provide a context and a point of reference for our study of the creative and varied explosion of postcolonial works after 1960."

In the twentieth century, a number of American writers, both Black and White, have written novels that engage the institution of slavery. What types of cultural work do these revisions of slavery perform? How do memory and history function in the American literary imagination? Our readings and discussions will focus on two emancipatory (commonly known as slave) narratives and several novels about slavery by African American writers. Additionally, we will read a number of novels by Anglo-American writers. Writers may include Frederick Douglass, Toni Morrison, Willa Cather and Valerie Martin. Students will also read a number of critical essays that engage the concepts of memory, history, and trauma. We will consider the following questions: what are some of the reasons for revisiting slavery in literature; how does the imagination augment our understanding of the past; why does slavery continue to haunt contemporary society; and what function does the contemporary narrative serve for its readers? In addition to the readings, students may expect a seminar paper, an annotated bibliography, several short response papers, and a presentation."

The course is literary and theoretical in its focus, ecocritical in its methods, and activist in its underlying assumption that close attention to literary and cultural representations of the natural world advances ecocentric thinking. We will examine a variety of critical approaches to nature writing, employing these practices to read a small group of (mostly) contemporary, (mostly) American essays and nonfiction narratives. Assigned readings will challenge easy definitions of \xE2\x80\x9Cnature writing,\xE2\x80\x9D ranging from the canonical and rural (Thoreau\xE2\x80\x99s Walden) to the genre-busting and urban (Colson Whitehead\xE2\x80\x99s The Colossus of New York). In their own research, seminar members will be encouraged to extend the intellectual compass of the course by developing green readings of texts from literatures, cultures, historical periods, and genres (including science writing) outside the immediate focus of the class. By definition, the graduate seminar offers a forum for intellectual exchange. Students will be expected to take an active role in the course as evidenced by close, critical attention to the readings; contributions to in-class colloquia led by seminar members; and organized presentations of their research proposals and bibliographies in a workshop format."

This three-fold approach is used in this course to elevate the process of financial statement analysis from one involving the mechanical calculation of a long list of financial statement ratios to one where the student (analyst/consultant) has an opportunity to integrate concepts from economics, strategy, accounting, and other business disciplines. In addition to introducing analytical tools for assessing profitability and risk, this course also examines the concepts of quality of earnings and it counterpart, the quality of financial position. The premise of this course is that the student will learn financial statement analysis most effectively by performing analysis on actual companies. Prerequisite: ACCT 550."

    :description: "This course is designed to fulfill one semester of the Georgetown College Literature/Writing requirement. It is taught in English and all readings are in English; it assumes no knowledge of French. The course combines the pleasure of reading imaginative literature with the need to move beyond the pleasure principle and take a more distanced perspective. Its focus is thematic and interpretive. The readings are selected from French, German, and English literature (20th-12th centuries); there is also a film. These texts are all linked thematically in that they are stories about growing up and finding one's identity. Growing up is a complex, mysterious, and sometimes arduous process that the hero/heroine experiences as a magical world where the natural laws governing human existence are suspended, the unexpected is bound to occur, and marvels are reserved for the chosen few. The choices to be made, dangers to be faced, and discoveries to be made, all help the hero/heroine relate to his/her own world and the conventional, mundane public world outside. Friendship, family, love, good and evil, authority and power, success and failure, responsibility, belief and knowledge and inexplicable mystery--these are essential experiences that structure and develop identity, in real life and in literature, today as well as yesterday. These readings are fantastic in both senses of the word: they create for their hero/heroine a magical world that is outside us readers and yet inside us too, and they are fabulous reading. This course does not count toward the French major or minor."

    :description: "A recent addition to the repertory of our French Theater Workshops is our offering of texts by African and Afro-Caribbean French-language playwrights, investigated theatrically in the very same spirit as all texts studied in these performance-based courses, ie. with an eye to helping all students experience the total intellectual and existential impact of the play-texts being studied through physical projection of word, gesture and emotion in space before a real-life audience. This time around, we\xE2\x80\x99ll be experimenting with exciting works by Caya Makh\xC3\xA9l\xC3\xA9, Julius-Am\xC3\xA9d\xC3\xA9 Laou, and Gilbert Doho. However, the crowning play of the course will be a brand new dramatic work, with spoken word, song and dance, by our resident French Department playwright Dr. Amadou Kon\xC3\xA9 : Sigui, Siguila, Siguiya. Student actors will perform this play in full at our new Davis Center for Performing Arts in Fall 2006, with auditions for major roles being held before the end of the Spring semester."

Most of the texts we will discuss are connected by the theme of a quest for historical truth. Many of them will take us right to the ugliest mysteries of the German past, and raise the problem of vengeance and redress. While many German artists have used the medium of crime fiction/drama/film to assert shared moral values by showing that which is evil, mad, or criminal, some reject the idea of a moral consensus. We will discuss how, when, and why various authors depict the quest for truth and justice. The reading material includes texts from various genres (novels, plays, film/tv, essays) and literary styles (expressionism, existentialism, realism, postmodernism). In sum, we will get to know some terrifically suspenseful, eerie, and unusual texts by some of Germany\xE2\x80\x99s best-known authors of the 20th century, acquaint ourselves with some of the century\xE2\x80\x99s persistent philosophical questions, and learn about its most important literary periods and styles."

How could such horror have come to pass, and twice? How does it effect being a human being? Because it is important both for active appreciation of the works and also for continuing improvement in German, students will have frequent written assignments and oral presentations. The method to be used will be that of a contemplative reading, a method that elicits reaction and realization on the part of the reader.

    :number: "472"
    :description: "Following the war in Iraq, the partnership between the United States and Europe reached a low point. Many commentators believed that this could lead to an ever-expanding rift. Most observers described the crisis in political, military and economic categories even though a good part of the transatlantic tension was the product of growing cultural and mental differences. Many of these issues are affected by differing historical experiences which resulted in divergent attitudes towards armament and the use of force. The European attitude towards Saddam Hussein was seen in the United States as \xE2\x80\x9Ctypical European powerlessness.\xE2\x80\x9D In Europe, America\xE2\x80\x99s willingness to wage war was viewed as representative of the \xE2\x80\x9Ctypical American cowboy attitude.\xE2\x80\x9D These stereotypes stem from cultural differences and cannot be explained by discrepancies in military budgets. Thus, it is obvious that the Iraq war served as a magnifying glass that made the fundamental differences between the transatlantic partners visible. These differences can be summarized by tangible philosophical disagreement: America and Europe have conflicting views about the meaning of the Enlightenment and about who can better protect its legacy. Key topics in this contestation include environmental protection, the separation of church and state, the death penalty, the Geneva Convention, international law, and cultural imperialism. This seminar will assess the transatlantic disagreements about the Iraq war by analyzing selected texts, essays, media reports, and political commentaries. Through reading key texts, we will follow the development of the transatlantic rift back to the Enlightenment. In examining the texts, we will look for repeated trends to determine whether the transatlantic rift will widen or close in the future. Are we at the beginning of a new understanding or a historic division?"

  - :name: Germany under the Bombs, 1939-1945
    :number: "562"
    :description: "The bombing raids on German cities during the Second World War have become a topic of much public discussion. The two most publicized events were W.G. Sebald\xE2\x80\x99s assertion in his provocative essay Literatur und Luftkrieg of 1999 that Germans had repressed the memory of their own suffering after defeat in 1945. From a different perspective, J\xC3\xB6rg Friedrichs in his volume Brand. Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940 \xE2\x80\x93 1945 presents a similar case from the perspective of a non-academic historian. To some extent, both publications laid claim to an interpretive context for the bombings of Hamburg, Dresden, N\xC3\xBCrnberg and other German cities that had long been the dominion of right wing extremists such as the historian David Irving. As a steady flow of publications in both English and German demonstrates, the debates stirred by Sebald\xE2\x80\x99s and Friedrich\xE2\x80\x99s publications were not short-lived media events but seem to have struck a cord with longer lasting reverberations. The course will explore some aspects of these discussions by combining a literary and histrical perspective on representations of the bombing raids on Germany during the Second World War, drawing on the disciplinary expertise of the two instructors."

The overall goal of this introductory course is not the mastery of various theoretical schools but, instead, a critical awareness of the multiple and often contradictory discourses that make up the fields of literary and cultural studies. Furthermore, the course encourages students to explore their own implicit assumptions underlying intuitive ways of reading literature. In an effort to make the often abstract and dense theoretical readings more accessible and more relevant to the analysis of texts, the course will take the following approach: 1. introduction to each theoretical approach (based on Lois Tyson\xE2\x80\x99s User-Friendly Guide) 2. selected readings of theoretical texts in both English and German, exemplifying the approach 3. analysis of a literary text based on the theoretical approaches"

  - :name: Monastery to Chatroom
    :number: "492"
    :description: "GOAL This Level V course offers a socioculturally oriented overview of the history and development of the German language between approximately 800 and the present. Through in-depth study of exemplary texts in the major periods that scholarship generally distinguishes (e.g., Old High German, Middle High German, Early New High German, New High German, and Contemporary German) students observe how the German language qua language contributed to the shaping of cultural contexts and specific communicative settings and, in turn, how its evolving morphology, syntax, vocabulary and texts were influenced by diverse public and private, external and internal interests, -- from the influences of religious communities to the influences of technology. Primary texts from different periods of the development of German will exemplify these diverse links and developments; additional secondary texts provide general background information as well as focused treatments of specific phenomena throughout this 1200 year time span. APPROACHES AND TASKS Following a chronological order, the course provides an opportunity for in-depth study of such genres as prayer, legal code, political treaty, courtly romance, mystical reflection, communication in business and trade, letters, political pamphlets, scientific prose, instructions in industrially and technology, political speech, newspaper language, and the genres of cyberspace. This enables us to explore phenomena such as - the sociopolitical and cultural context of the occurrence of a text - the particular setting of the text, with consideration of internal and external influences on the creation and shaping of the text; - sounds, morphology, word formation, syntax, vocabulary; - medium, standard, dialect influences, orthography; - textual organization, register, style, genre, literary language, poetic form; - political and religious ideology; - authorship and readership. From monastery to chatroom contributes to the development of advanced literacy in German by emphasizing close reading of relatively short texts in terms of their cultural contexts. The reading of primary texts is further informed by diverse secondary texts. For their final paper, a literature review of a particular topic, students will receive extensive guidance throughout the course.

    :number: "559"
    :description: "This graduate level course aims to analyze the partnership between the United States and Europe since the Iraq war. Many commentators believe that this disagreement will get worse over time. Most observers describe the crisis in political, military, and economic terms. However, much of the transatlantic tension is the product of growing cultural differences. The question of how to deal with threats and arms controls has played a significant role in the debate. Yet, the degree of arms maintained is unique to each country based on individual historical experiences. European hesitation about ousting Saddam Hussein was seen in the USA as \xE2\x80\x9Ctypical European weakness.\xE2\x80\x9D The American willingness to go to war was seen in Europe as \xE2\x80\x9Ctypical American Cowboy attitude.\xE2\x80\x9D However, these differences are cultural and cannot be explained solely by varying sizes in the military budget. The Iraq war acted as a magnifying glass and clarified older and fundamental differences between the transatlantic partners. This opposition can be summarized philosophically: America and Europe disagree about important questions concerning the heritage of the Enlightenment and which of them can better protect this legacy."

    :description: The goal of the course is to provide an introduction to the functional analysis of language, using Hallidayan systemic functional linguistics as the theoretical frame of reference and English as the exemplar language. The course introduces students to general concepts of this socioculturally oriented model of grammar with its explicit focus on meaning in oral and written texts and familiarizes them with different conceptual and analytical tools that are available for such analyses. Because systemic-functional linguistics provides considerable resources for literacy-oriented and interpretive approaches to language learning and use, it is particularly well suited for principled approaches to the pedagogy of advanced L2 learning, including advanced reading and writing, L2 learning by heritage learner, and L2 instruction for academic and professional purposes.

  - :name: Political Theater in 20th Century Germany
    :number: "653"
    :description: "In the twentieth century, theater artists and reformers began to question and change the role that the institution had taken on during the Enlightenment, namely to help shape a national culture and identity by educating and refining the audience\xE2\x80\x99s moral sentiments. As class struggle sharpened during the industrial revolution, the liberal bourgeois concept of the nation came to be seen as repressive of democratic public discourse, and incapable of accommodating the challenges to political and cultural authority on the part of the various radical social movements that flourished in the early part of the century. Weimar era artists like Bertolt Brecht and Erwin Piscator, Marieluise Fleisser and Else Lasker-Sch\xC3\xBCler also grappled more fundamentally with the socially affirmative dramatic conventions encoded in Aristotle, Schiller, and Nietzsche\xE2\x80\x99s theoretical writings about drama. They imagined a political poetics that would transform the theater into a laboratory for social change, and transform the spectator from passive object of education to active, critical participant. Their experiments continue to inform political theater today, although contemporary artists no longer grapple with the nation as primary object of critique, but wrestle with globalization and the effects it has had on notions of artistic autonomy, the public sphere, and democracy\xE2\x80\x99s capacity to integrate diverse constituencies. The course will introduce students to the important poetological debates and concerns that twentieth-century theater artists and theorists worked through. We will read key plays in the context of these debates, trace the diverging notions of political theater in East and West Germany, and spend a good amount of time on the analysis of contemporary theater (available on videotape, but we will also go see a play together). The course is heavy on reading, and emphasis will be placed on discussion. Each student will be responsible for introducing one of the plays, and kick off class discussion by raising questions about it, and connecting it to the theoretical issues we will discuss. Because the course is relatively heavy on reading, there will be two written assignments: one 2-page paper about a performance, and a longer paper (ca. 15 pages) about a topic of your choice (about a play, an author, a topic, poetological question, etc.). During the last weeks, students will develop their own research projects, and design a class session (including selection of readings) in consultation with the instructor. First drafts of the final papers will be due on 4/28 for collective peer review. Course readings will include both German and English, theoretical and dramatic texts, as well as reviews. Please note that in March we will meet 3 evenings to watch videos of plays. We\xE2\x80\x99ll discuss what play(s) to watch together."

What is this unit and what kind of system does culture signify? Or, what is it exactly that we as humanities scholars do when we study culture? This course explores the tensions and complexities of this concept within a German eighteenth-century that increasingly tied the notion of culture to a theory of modernity. In this course, we will be especially interested in observing and examining theories of language that can help us better to understand the vexed relations among language-culture-history. To what extent do these eighteenth-century traditions take language as a model for conceptualizing culture. In the first part of the course, we will devote ourselves to the careful study of key Enlightenment texts by Goethe, Schiller, Herder, Hamman, Kant and Lessing. In the second part of the course, we will consider Romanticism\xE2\x80\x99s response and reformulation of the Enlightenment notion of culture in texts by Kleist, H\xC3\xB6lderlin, Schleiermacher, W. von Humboldt, Novalis and Schlegel. Issues to be explored include: the understanding of language as mimetic representation vs. world-making and performative; the relationship of culture and freedom; the place of the aesthetic in history and culture; culture as an implicit theory of modernity; the lyric as modern form."

Through a theoretical and practical investigation of the contexts of diverse texts, participants become aware of the nature of human consciousness under particular cultural and historical conditions. Beyond such general considerations, the course focuses on the experience of second/foreign language learning, construction of the self through and in light of language use, and the increasingly problematic assumption of a privileged monolingualism and its consequent construction of the "native" and the "non-native" or "foreign." Through diverse "border crossings" it highlights the condition of German culture and the German language as both the Native and the Foreign.

The course will take a look at the German cinematic tradition focusing on three areas: films of the 1920's and 1930's, post-war films as reflections on the state of Germany, and films that deal with the relationship between Germany and the United States (or the dominance of Hollywood in film-making.) Parallel with the exploration of films, we will develop an appropriate level of understanding of film history, film theory, and various approaches to interpreting film."

    :description: "Turkish-Germans and Turks living in Germany together comprise Germany\xE2\x80\x99s largest ethnic minority group. Beginning in the 1960s, so-called Gastarbeiter were recruited from Turkey to provide labor needed to fuel Germany\xE2\x80\x99s postwar Wirtschaftswunder. Turkish immigrants introduced ethnic, religious, and economic difference into a German society that had been radically homogenized as a result of Nazi genocide. Although it was originally assumed that the residence of Turkish \xE2\x80\x9Cguest workers\xE2\x80\x9D would only be temporary, many chose instead to bring their families to join them, and to relocate permanently to Germany. As this new group struggles to define its place in German society, competing models have been submitted for how this might best be accomplished. German reactions, meanwhile, have ranged from the exclusionary practices of reactionary xenophobia to progressive struggles in support of an integrated society welcoming of diversity. Using literature, film, popular music, and the press, we will examine important moments and key social debates in the history of this struggle. Primary course readings will be in German (approximately 30 pages per class meeting), additional secondary material will be in English. Class discussion will be conducted in German, and all written work will be submitted in German."

This second course explores how notions of Heimat and Germanness changed in the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust. We will look briefly at the early post-war period, but special attention will be given to literature, film, and culture in the pre- and post-unification periods (1980s; 1990s). While topics that were considered in the first course continue to play a role (i.e., gendered notions of Heimat/nation; issues of inclusion/exclusion), the overarching question of this second course is: to what extent and with what effects are national(ist) and, more recently, transnational forces counteracted by a revival of local identities? We will examine changing representations of Heimat by considering examples in literature and film, essays, speeches, and selected secondary literature."

Using Richard Neustadt's theory of presidential power as a starting point, the seminar considers the types of presidential power and the ways in which recent presidents have attempted to attain their goals in a system of "separated institutions, sharing powers." It then turns to a consideration of the dynamics of the legislative process, employing a theory based on Theodore Lowi's insight that "policy determines politics". This seminar focuses on major case studies of the President, Congress and law making. The seminar considers both the Clinton and the two Bush presidencies and the dynamics of congressional-presidential relationships in an era of closely divided government. The emphasis will be on case studies so that students can draw their own inferences as to the causes of "gridlock" and the politics of policy making (when policy is made) under current political conditions. Internships will allow students to participate in the policy making process either by working in the Congress, the Executive Branch or with an organization involved in the policy making process at the national level. Each student should devote 12-16 hours per week to an internship in accordance with an agreed upon plan.

However, Berlusconi\xE2\x80\x99s controversial position as a media mogul and head of the government have not made things easier.

    :number: "356"
    :description: "Nuclear weapons play an enigmatic role in international politics. On the one hand, these weapons have the potential to inflict harm orders of magnitude greater than other methods of attack, and are arguably the only near-term threat to the survival of the human race, however remote that possibility. On the other hand, nuclear weapons have only been used in anger in one conflict, shortly after their invention, and appear less and less relevant to addressing the major security challenges of the day, whether extremist groups utilizing terrorist tactics or revisionist states seeking to upend the status quo in their regions. This course seeks to illuminate the role that nuclear weapons play in international politics by blending theory, history, technology, and policy. Theory allows us to generalize from historical cases, a firm grasp of technological realities helps us understand technological possibilities and constraints, and together these help illuminate current nuclear weapons-related policy challenges. Course structure: The course is divided into five segments. The first segment will cover technological and historical information that will provide a foundation for our subsequent work. The second segment will review the theoretical debates over nuclear weapons, addressing the questions of why states pursue nuclear weapons, how significant nuclear weapons are in international politics, and whether and under what conditions nuclear weapons are stabilizing or destabilizing. The third segment will assess nuclear dangers, including vertical proliferation within states that already possess nuclear weapons, horizontal proliferation to states not previously possessing weapons, and the potential for proliferation to non-state actors. The fourth segment will evaluate tools for reducing nuclear dangers, including deterrence, denial and containment, arms control and abolition, cooperative threat reduction, missile defense, military force, and homeland defense, using the current debate over U.S. nuclear weapons policy as a common theme throughout the discussions. Finally, the fifth segment will apply what we have learned to current policy challenges of North Korea, Iran, and non-state nuclear acquisition.

    :number: "358"
    :description: "As the literature on international institutions has gone beyond the initial question of whether \xE2\x80\x9Cinstitutions matter\xE2\x80\x9D, it has evolved into a compelling and fruitful discussion, asking: how do institutions matter? And, why do some institutions succeed better than others? This seminar lets students approach both of these fundamental questions through the lens of institutional design. We will look at the challenges facing international institutions through the mechanisms used to address them. We will be asking questions such as: why are some institutions based on hard binding law, whereas others are based on soft law, and less binding commitments? Why do some rely on centralized enforcement, like the IMF, while others rely on decentralized enforcement within the membership, as in the GATT-WTO? Why do some include dispute settlement mechanisms, while others have no apparent need for them? What drives the variation in voting and decision-making mechanisms? What determines the inclusion of escape clauses, safeguards, and renegotiation clauses aiming for greater flexibility within the institution? Do institutions evolve in predictable ways? The objective of the course, in short, is to match the cooperation challenges identified within institutional theory with the features found in real institutions trying to address those challenges."

    :number: "369"
    :description: "Violent conflict has marked relationships between nations, societies, and cultures since at least the beginning of recorded history. War\xE2\x80\x99s prevention, conduct, and resolution are inevitably the essential first challenges of every state. These challenges may be met by mobilization and belligerence, surrender and submission, or alliance and interdependence. Each of these options can be credited with either the survival or the disappearance of nations and societies throughout history. The central framework for both studying and implementing security is strategy. The term is often misused to describe what are actually tactics or, at best, the collection of tactics into an operational plan. True strategy is a nation\xE2\x80\x99s systematic, balanced application of all state powers and capabilities toward the development, maintenance, defense, and advancement of national interests. It involves obvious components of military power, diplomacy, and economics. It also involves a nation\xE2\x80\x99s natural resources and geography, demographics, public health, education system, domestic political institutions, political culture, and other factors \xE2\x80\x93although not routinely considered when one thinks of security\xE2\x80\x94that historically have been crucial to national survival. Given the comprehensive nature of security, its study must encompass every aspect of political science\xE2\x80\x94alliances, political economy, diplomacy, international organizations, domestic politics, budgeting , philosophy, international law, etc., etc.\xE2\x80\x94as well as a wide range of other disciplines, to include history, geography, psychology, economics, physics, philosophy, biology, and anthropology. It is reasonable to suggest that political science is a subset of security studies, rather than the reverse. Analogies and parallels can be made from age to age; but, for each conflict, there are unique, context-dependent dimensions that make it extremely risky to rely on one fixed and unchanging set of rules and procedures. Despite the absence of a \xE2\x80\x98magic template\xE2\x80\x99, there are procedures for analyzing, balancing, and applying all the elements of a state\xE2\x80\x99s strengths and weaknesses. Data will change; priorities will shift; circumstances will vary. What remains constant is the need for a comprehensive national strategy that reflects dangers as well as opportunities. Student course objectives include: * Identifying and discussing the historical and philosophical foundations of the study and practice of international security * Identifying and explaining why and how these foundations have been either altered or sustained over time * Applying lessons learned to specific historic and contemporary case studies * Identifying future security challenges * Determining strengths and weaknesses in existing security literature while developing coherent, informed, alternative hypotheses * Identifying and acknowledging what is not yet known or understood, whether by the individual student or by the discipline as a whole * Never losing sight of the great risks, failures of good intentions, human flaws and strengths, and enormous human tragedies that result in, occur during, and define the aftermath of war Course requirements include: * Presentation of a one-page journal review * Two, six-page book critiques * Policy making/debate exercise conducted in small groups * Final examination * Active participation in class discussions Full syllabus and reading schedule will be posted prior to fall term.

In the center of the phenomenon stands the Jewish Holocaust, recognized today as the turning point of human history. It emerged out of what seemed the height of European progress and development, civilization and culture. It affected nearly every country on the continent. The aim of this course is to introduce the students to the history of the encounter between political, sociological, ideological and cultural components that unable genocide to happen. Special focus will be put on the Third Reich and the Jews of Europe and the context in which the murder of almost 6 million Jews took place.

We follow the Cold War from early suspicions to the balance of terror, from Berlin to Saigon to Beirut-and, more comically, from official rhetoric to bureaucratic bungling. We examine how a struggle begun amid the ruins of Hitlerism finally resulted in a victory that nourishes great opportunities and terrible new dangers today. Our path is an interdisciplinary one involving not only political studies but also military strategies, business economics, and technology management.

If so, in what form? 2) Is the idea of class useful for making sense of the cultural changes now occurring in those societies?

    :description: "The last several decades have seen a resurgence of religion in world politics. Political science continues to focus attention on key questions of war and peace, democracy and dictatorship, and the state and the economy. Religion is not displacing those topics. But its resilience in advanced industrialized societies and its vibrancy in the developing world are casting established research agendas in a new light. International terrorism, for example, raises questions about the religious sources of violence. Drives for democratization and human rights focus attention on their compatibility or incompatibility with particular religious traditions. Breakthroughs in the life sciences set off political and religious controversies about the promise of technology and the sanctity of human life. And economic and political globalization generates contacts across cultures and creates new opportunities for interreligious conflict and cooperation. The course will explore the intersection of religion and politics in these four areas -- violence, democracy, science, and globalization. It will be heavy on theory: the very best efforts to conceptualize the intersection of religion and politics in a changing world. But it will also be problem driven. Working alone and in small groups, students will have a chance to explore particular controversies in-depth and relate them to the overarching themes of the course.

    :description: "Approaches and Topics in American Politics What do political scientists know about American politics? How do political scientists study American politics? What are the main debates regarding theory, methods, and substance? What can we teach our students about American politics? GOALS We have three main goals this semester. First, we will introduce you to the key readings in American politics across a wide range of political institutions, political behavior, and public policy. Second, we will explore the various methodological approaches used to investigate these topics. Third, we will enhance your ability to write, speak and teach across these topics. EXPECTATIONS A skilled political scientist will understand a broad range of theoretical, methodological and empirical literature; will be able to speak and write about the strengths and weaknesses of the literature; and will be able to convey the essence of the literature to other students and scholars. In this course I expect that you will begin to develop this broader understanding and will strengthen your ability to speak and write about American politics. We will do LOTS of reading in this course. I mean \xE2\x80\x98we\xE2\x80\x99 literally. Some of the readings are new to me, or I read them last when I was preparing for my comps (in, ahem, the mid-1980s). I\xE2\x80\x99m excited by the reading list, and I hope it will enthuse you also. As you are preparing to become scholars, teachers, or practitioners, I have chosen to combine classic writings, current research, and textbook material in the reading list. As many of you will have the opportunity to teach an \xE2\x80\x9CIntroduction to the American Political System\xE2\x80\x9D course, I have structured the readings along the lines of a typical textbook (except for the fact that I placed the Constitution, federalism, and civil rights and liberties at the end of the semester). Each week we will read chapters from two excellent American government texts, noting their differing approaches, common elements, and conventional wisdom. With this as a base, we will delve more deeply into the scholarly literature on these topics. The seminar is not intended to provide a complete survey of the field. Students planning to sit for comprehensive exams in American politics are expected to master recommended readings on their own and also to study other texts from the comprehensive exam reading lists.

    :description: "As the first branch mentioned in the Constitution, Congress plays an amazingly central role in American politics. This class is designed to provide students with a theoretical and practical understanding of how Congress works and what the implications are for American democracy. Many of the insights \xE2\x80\x93 and a few of the readings \xE2\x80\x93 extend to other legislatures more generally. The specific goals of the class vary by student type. For Ph.d level students, the major goals will be to on master the debates in the scholarly literature and to learn the art of formulating and testing interesting research hypotheses about how Congress works. For Master\xE2\x80\x99s level students, the focus will be on learning the basics of the scholarly approach, while also developing skills in integrating the academic and historical literature with current debates. This class will address both theoretical and practical issues in the study of Congress. Theory will provide frameworks and concepts that students can apply to the ever-changing landscape of congressional politics and to legislative bodies in states and other nations. At the same time, much of the class will be geared toward learning about Congress as it is and was in all the messiness of reality. Doing so helps us better understand and assess theories and helps us ask the most interesting questions both in discussions and in research. Among the topics we will cover are the historical development of Congress, the procedures and institutions of Congress, determinants of voting and representation by members of Congress, lobbying and interest groups, how elections are won and how this affects the institution and the relationship between Congress and other branches of government."

    :description: This seminar on law and politics will focus on courts and legal doctrine as political agents and will explore the institutional, rhetorical and procedural dimensions of "legalized politics." A central focus of this inquiry will be how law - its institutions, its idioms, its processes and its assumptions - shapes the acquisition, deployment and maintenance of power. In short, if politics is about power, what difference does it make to the pursuit and maintenance of that power if much of our politics is pursued within legal venues? Because law as a field of practice and as a field of inquiry stretches across many disciplinary boundaries, the materials we will be studying in this course will be eclectic, drawing from political science, history, the legal academy, public policy and political theory. The substantive topics will include constitutional and legal theory; law and ideology; judicial decision-making and processes; courts and social policy. [American Government]

    :description: "Political Economy and International Political Economy are fast growing fields of study that focus on the methodological and substantive intersection of economics and political science. This class emphasizes the methodological tools and techniques that underlie much of the current research in this field. These models and techniques allow us to structure our thinking about fundamental concepts regarding the nature of political and economic preferences, the problems of preference aggregation and the link between policy preferences and policy outcomes, problems of collective action, and strategic interaction. Mastering these tools and techniques is important for understanding the major works in the field and contributing to it. Students are expected to use these tools and techniques in courses throughout the PECO/IPEC majors to analyze substantive issues of the field (such as economic development, the politics of trade or finance, government-business relations, etc.). Most important, all students will be required to write a article-length research paper on a topic of their choosing during the spring of the senior year as part of PECO/IPEC401. In that paper, students are expected to apply the analytical techniques learned in this course and their statistics courses. Throughout the major, students are encouraged to keep a notebook of ideas and topics that they find interesting which could serve as the foundation of their PECO/IPEC401 paper. This course is team-taught by a political scientist and economist. Prerequisites: Microeconomic Theory (ECON-101) and one foundation government course.

    :description: "Hannah Arendt was a German political theorist who emigrated to the United States in the wake of the Holocaust. A student of Heidegger\xE2\x80\x99s in her youth, Arendt was deeply concerned about modern threats to individual freedom and in the kinds of relationships necessary to sustain democratic politics. However, as she matured, her political philosophy moved away from its Heideggarian roots and toward her own unique understanding of the role of politics in public life. This seminar will introduce students to Arendt\xE2\x80\x99s political philosophy as well as to some of the excellent commentary on her work that has appeared in the last few years. We will approach Arendt\xE2\x80\x99s work with an eye towards three themes in particular: (1) her love of the ancient Greeks and their mode of agonistic politics, (2) her concern for the disappearance of individual judgment and agency under totalitarian conditions, and (3) her idea of freedom as both public and political. Students in this seminar will write one short (5-7 pp) paper and one longer (15-20 pp) paper during the course of the semester. For the longer paper, students may choose one of three approaches: (1) compare Arendt\xE2\x80\x99s thought on a particular concept (judgment, freedom, etc.) with two other political theorists\xE2\x80\x99 views on the same subject; (2) apply Arendt\xE2\x80\x99s theorizing to an actual problem or set of issues in contemporary politics, or (3) evaluate one of the critiques or commentaries we will read and offer arguments either for or against Arendt\xE2\x80\x99s theories.

    :description: "This course takes as its point of departure an argument Louis Hartz made in the 1950s. Liberalism, according to Hartz, is the only intellectual tradition that has ever had any claim to widespread resonance in the United States. It follows from this that anyone aspiring to understand, to criticize, or to participate in American public life needs to be articulate about the tradition of liberal theory and practice in America. Taking Hartz's analysis seriously, though not as the last word, this course will be organized around three main purposes: (1) to make clear what Hartz meant when he described America as a liberal society; (2) to determine whether his claim was (and is still) defensible; and (3) to explore whether the consequences\xE2\x80\x94both good and ill\xE2\x80\x94of an unreflective embrace of liberalism are observable in America today. To achieve these purposes we will read the work of cultural observers like Hartz, Tocqueville, Alan Wolfe and David Cole, the arguments of an array of liberal theorists ranging from John Locke to James Madison to John Rawls, as well as challenges to the Hartz thesis like that made recently by Michael Sandel.[Politial Theory]"

We will examine what scholars refer to as the sociology of the legal profession. We will compare the institutional settings in which lawyers practice law, and we will study the complexities that are introduced into the practice of law by two external factors: the lawyer's ethical obligations, and the economics of practicing law. We will read one book (A Civil Action) that provides a panoramic view of a real lawsuit and the decisions--tactical, ethical, and practical--lawyers must make during the litigation process. Lastly, we will spend the last several weeks of the seminar investigating and developing the skills lawyers must possess to be well-skilled in their calling. You will attend a portion of a trial to observe the way lawyers function in the courtroom and assess whether the \"lawyering\" you saw was effective. You will receive lessons in legal research and legal writing, and we'll apply those lessons to the mock-litigation of an actual case.

The first half of the course will develop a conceptual and analytic understanding of fascism, primarily within the historical and empirical context of national-socialism in Germany. It considers some of the following questions: What is fascism? Under what conditions and how does it arise? What are its main tenets and principles? Who are its supporters and/or beneficiaries? How central are such concepts as modernization, totalitarianism, and anti-Semitism to our understanding of the fascist phenomenon? Was fascism unique to the 1920s and 1930s, or does it continue to adapt and exist under different conditions today? The second half of the course will explore other countries from various time periods, in order to compare and contrast different forms of fascism and quasi-fascist movements. For the pre-1945 period, one session will be devoted to Italian fascism and another to a series of countries from both Western and Eastern Europe. For the post-war period, the course will cover contemporary right-wing extremism in Europe, white-power and black-power extremism in the United States, and religious extremism around the world. The purpose of these wider comparisons is to shed light on the question of fascism?s historical uniqueness, and to consider whether it could return once again in the future--a theme the course will consider in the final session.

In this seminar we will do that. Consequently, it might be thought of as an attempt to step into an ongoing conversation among liberals about foreign affairs. The course will be organized around two cases when societies embodying liberal ideas and institutions were forced, in no small part by their rise to global preeminence, to come to terms with what it meant to be liberals abroad: (1) the British Empire; and (2) the contemporary United States. In the British case we will interrogate the arguments of Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill, and J.A. Hobson. The larger portion of the semester will be devoted to contemporary American liberals, including John Rawls, David Gauthier, Richard Rorty, and Michael Walzer. In each case, we will endeavor to situate liberal arguments in their larger philosophical and historical contexts. Our central concern will, however, be foreign affairs. We will ask: When liberals envision an ideal world, what are its characteristic features? Should liberals promote liberal ideas and institutions abroad? Which ones? And how? From within this conversation seminar participants will be expected to develop compelling arguments about how we should comport ourselves abroad. [Political Theory]"

    :number: "335"
    :description: Spring 2006 Historically, civic republicanism laid the groundwork for modern liberalism's astounding success; yet it has always been one of liberalism's fiercest critics. From the ancients forward, civic republicanism has taught that the preservation of fragile states requires clear-eyed social analysis and cunning institutional design. Civic republicanism is in this way one of the few political theories that can be credited with launching actual states, including republics from ancient Rome to Renaissance Florence to the modern United States. At the same time civic republican theorists seem perpetually dissatisfied with the republics that have resulted, lambasting them especially for their moral shortcomings. Indeed, in their obsessive attention to the moral virtues that republican rule requires of its citizens, civic republican theorists often drift into normative aspirations for republics that go far beyond mere political stability. In this seminar, we will focus on both the pragmatism and the perfectionism of republican theory in a series of conversations about influential civic republican theorists such as Aristotle, Machiavelli, Rousseau, and Madison.

In poor and rich countries alike, voluntary organizations are seen by some as enhancing development and democracy by providing services, calling attention to problems, stimulating civic engagement, demanding government accountability, and increasing social capital. Acting internationally, non-state organizations have influenced major actors such as the United Nations, the World Trade Organization, and the World Bank.

The changing nature of the security threat requires a reevaluation of several fundamental aspects of international politics, including the value of allies, military strategies and tactics, and the influence of both international structure and norms, all of which will be examined throughout this course. The seminar is broken down into two parts, theoretical and empirical. The first part of the course will be a conceptual examination of how international conflict and power in international politics have shifted since the end of the Cold War, with a focus on the nature of threats, the value of allies, the role of international organizations, and strategies and tactics. The second part of the course consists of case studies, including the Gulf War, Somalia, Bosnia, Afghanistan, and Iraq; this half of the course evaluates US interventions in practice, considers the broad policy arguments in favor of or opposed to these interventions, the relevant actors, and the degree of success and failure by way of distilling key operational lessons and identifying post Cold War trends in the use of force.

Yet the very word \xE2\x80\x9Ccampaign\xE2\x80\x9D derives from battlefield jargon. Campaigns and election in the United States constitute institutionalized warfare in which candidates with (more or less) opposing views contend for power. Critics of the system decry dirty politics, negative advertising, special interest cash, and insincere politicians. Enthusiasts glory in the cut and thrust of campaigns, the free-wheeling debate, the high strategy, the low tactics, and the thrill and agony of Election Day. This course is designed to unveil American campaigning with all its warts and beauty, introducing students to both election theory and practice at the local, state, and Federal level. Students looking to study political science seriously will gain grounding in the academics of campaigns and elections; students interested in exploring politics will get exposure to real campaign operatives and media figures. The course covers early views of American democracy; important theories of electoral behavior and electioneering and debates within the political science literature; real-world campaign component parts such as candidate communications and the press, campaign finance and fundraising, and the rising role of special interest third parties; and specifics of running for local office, Congress, and the Presidency."

Starting with a brief overview of the ancient taproots of anti-Semitism, the class scrutinizes modern thinkers who evince an obsession with Jews and those who seek to explain the causes and effects of this particular fixation. In addition to classic anti-Semitic tracts (e.g., The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Mein Kampf and the work of various renowned "high-culture" anti-Semites) writers to be read include Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre, Hannah Arendt, Philip Roth, Pierre Birnbaum, and Arthur Hertzberg. The course ends with a survey of contemporary concerns such as the relation between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and the philo-Semitism to be found among modern-day Christian fundamentalists.

Yet, there are also many inherent tensions between the principle of sovereignty and the body of international law that has been produced through group interaction within the modern state system. Global environmental and security threats, nationalist and irredentist movements, and economic and cultural globalization have posed significant challenges to the principle, causing some scholars to point to the possible decline of the sovereign state system. The purpose of this course will be to familiarize students with the fundamental ways in which the international legal principle of sovereignty is both protected and challenged in international relations. Towards this end, every class will focus on one of the major issue area in which the future of sovereignty is being challenged. Each class will begin with a lecture on the international legal rules and cases involved. The second part of class will consist of short (10 minute) student presentations on the readings for that day, followed by class discussion and debate.

    :description: What is an 'authoritarian' regime? How is it distinct from democracies on the one hand and totalitarian dictatorships on the other? How does it emerge and sustain its power? Do citizens engage in politics under such regimes? This seminar tackles the ubiquitous yet elusive category of authoritarian rule, exploring the multiplicity and plasticity of this regime type from 19th century incarnations to the present, including the rehabilitation of authoritarian systems after an optimistic 'third wave' of democratizaton in the 1970s. We examine the domestic and international variables that both prop up and undermine such systems, giving particular attention to diverse citizen responses to authoritarian rule, from 'everyday resistance' to 'civil society' acticism to insurgent movements to full-scale revolutions. The seminar is designed to familiarize you with some classic theoretical literature in the subfield of comparative politics and the acquaint you with the details of several country cases. Both political history and theory are embedded in each of the readings for the course. By semester's end, we should all have a clearer understanding of why authoritarianism is the rule, democracy the exception, and how citizens living under authoritarian regimes have long worked to invert this reality.

    :description: "Jewish communities, regardless of their different locations, have used language as a major marker of collective identity and group vitality (along with other variables such as history, ancestry and religion). The dominating linguistic pattern of Jews was often trilingual: the reading of Hebrew, the relevant territorial languages, and some Jewish language. This pattern kept changing over history, often related to political developments that brought about different language ideologies and practices, especially towards and after the establishment of the state of Israel: it was then that Hebrew began to serve as a major tool representing national ideologies of Jews and symbolizing the national collective identity of Jews immigrating to Palestine. It was also then that Zionist ideology struggled against other languages of the Jews, especially against Yiddish. Nowadays in Israel, Hebrew is the official language (along with Arabic), Yiddish is used only by Ultra Orthodox communities, and English is widespread in terms of its use (after Hebrew) in all domains of life. The course focuses on and explores the different languages used by Jewish communities in the context of political entities of nation-states and institutions (schools, communities, religious and cultural affiliations) in different places where Jews currently reside. It examines these issues in historical terms as well as in current linguistic landscapes. It surveys the multiple of Jewish languages used over the years, their relationship with collective and personal identities, and the role of these languages as expressions of cultural, religious and political environments. It will examine the methods of reviving spoken Hebrew, the struggle of Hebrew against other Jewish languages. It examines the current declared and de facto language policies of Israel, the role of Hebrew in the continuous effort to maintain a political homogenous national identity, the attitudes towards \xE2\x80\x98the other\xE2\x80\x99 languages (Arabic as well as immigrant languages), and the various Jewish languages currently emerging in different Jewish communities around the world.

    :description: "This is a Government Department Seminar for advanced undergraduate students. It is also open to Graduate Students in SFS MA programs. Because it is a new course, the full syllabus will be available in August. Department Seminars focus on writing and research. Assignments for the course will consist of several short analytical essays and one longer paper focusing on an individual comparative research project. THE PROBLEM: Communism as an economic and social system was abandoned almost everywhere within a remarkably short period of time, a period that coincided with the late 20th century era of globalization. We will begin by exploring the relationship between globalization and the demise of Communism. The bulk of the semester will be devoted to examining the main social-economic systems that have replaced communism in the context of globalization. About a dozen countries are geographically situated to join the European Union. While this process will be neither smooth nor painless, it is pretty straightforward. For other countries, there are two major development models. China offers the model of economic integration with the global economy without ending Communist Party rule. Soviet leaders introduced major political changes in an attempt to advance economic reforms, leading to the breakup of the USSR. Many Russian leaders express ambivalence about Western models of development, arguing that there is a \"third way\" between American-dominated global capitalism and their communist past. Both China and Russia have been among the world's fastest-growing economies in the first years of the 21st century. They present two competing models for development, differing markedly in their structural and existential relationships with the global economy. While Russia and China will be our primary focus, we will respect Mark Bloch's admonition that any comparison must involve more than two cases by making frequent reference to the experience of ex-communist EU accession countries and India. MAJOR THEMES: After examining the exit from communism in the context of globalization and the basic development models in Russia and China, we will compare the two countries across a range of issues including WTO accession, labor, business and the middle class, civil society, crime and corruption, income differentials and welfare, religion and culture, and human capital.

  - :name: "Dept Sem: Statecraft & Negotiation in the Middle East"
    :number: "411"
    :description: "This course will look at American foreign policy through the lens of statecraft. Statecraft involves the orchestration of all the instruments of power and influence to protect against threats and to promote broad national interests. Key elements of statecraft include developing strategy, defining objectives and purposes, identifying the means available for pursuing that strategy, and then knowing how best to employ those means. If there is one instrument or policy tool that is central to nearly all forms of statecraft, it is negotiations. This course will thus take a closer look at the American approach to negotiations and how best to pursue them. It will also explore mediation as a policy tool for helping to settle or defuse local and sectarian conflicts and as a means of promoting a more favorable image of the U.S. internationally. To set a context for understanding statecraft and how it can best be employed, the initial part of the course will focus on the American ethos and self image, and how it relates to our conduct of foreign policy. The next section of the course will be geared toward distilling the essential parts of statecraft by looking at several historical and contemporary cases in which different administrations identified important American interests and employed a variety of policy tools to try to achieve them: US policy in advance of the Suez war in 1956 and the June 1967 war; German unification in NATO in 1990/91; the U.S. role in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process; and, the Iraq war of 2003 and its aftermath. The third part of the course examines policy instruments such as negotiations and mediation from a practitioner's standpoint. The concluding part of the course will discuss issues that are confronting the US today and explore how an effective approach rooted in statecraft would shape US choices, policies, and the tools used to carry them out. Students will be expected to do the readings for the course in advance of each class. Class participation will count for 25% of the grade. The remaining 75% will be determined by a research paper that each student will write. The paper should be roughly 20 pages and take a historical case and make an assessment of how effective an Administration's approach to statecraft was, and how, and in what ways it might have been improved.

This seminar will examine whether \xE2\x80\x9Cpolitical lies\xE2\x80\x9D are inherent to democracy or represent its corruption. Does truth have any place and role to play in politics (Arendt)? If so, what is the status of truth? Lying has been justified by such philosophers as Plato and Machiavelli as a means of governance. Lying has even become a central method of government (Lenin, totalitarianism). Postmodernism takes another approach by relativizing values and depreciating the concept of truth itself (Nietzsche, Foucault). These concepts also have a direct bearing on current affairs. The class assignments will include weekly homework papers, and require students to examine one political scandal in the light of the theoretical principles studied in class (some options will be given). The result of their investigations will be presented in class. [Political Theory]"

Second, students learn to analyze these trends using relevant theories of international relations-the English School, constructivism, and network analysis.

    :description: "Ever since the publication of John Rawls\xE2\x80\x99 Theory of Justice (1973) liberalism has enjoyed a renaissance as a moral and political philosophy. But that same renaissance has also given rise to sustained criticism from a number of different points of view. For every important book defending the adequacy of liberal ideas as a basis for conducting the public life of democratic societies that has appeared in our time there has been another challenging that claim. Some of the most interesting criticism of this sort has come from authors who choose to characterize their work as post-liberal. These are people who are obviously sympathetic to much of what contemporary liberal thinking represents and yet are convinced that ultimately it is inadequate. So they seek to go beyond what liberals have achieved in a direction that speaks to the concerns reflected in their critique. This course is a seminar designed to examine critically some of the better work being done in this vein; the readings are drawn from the writings of such figures as Charles Taylor, Michael Walzer, Martha Nussbaum, John Gray, and William Connolly."

First, the class is designed to advance understanding of statistical theory by providing a foundation of fundamental concepts. Second, the course introduces a variety of specific statistical applications that are frequently used in political science. Third, the class seeks to teach students how to translate the theory into substantive research. More specifically, these goals can be described as the following: (1) To deepen and broaden understanding of linear regression models. Emphasis will be on extending the basic model and on diagnostics, including those related to influential data, heteroscedasticity and multicollinearity; (2) To introduce logit and probit models for the analysis of dichotomous data. Often our substantive interest centers on dichotomous variables: there is a war or there is not; a person votes or does not; a committee reports a bill or it does not. The linear regression model does not accommodate such variables as dependent variables and we must therefore learn specialized models, such as probit and logit models, for dealing with them; (3) To gain experience in applying rigorous statistical methods to important empirical issues. Fluency in statistical methods only comes with experience. Therefore, this class seeks to provide the complete statistical experience, from the development of hypotheses, to the gathering of data, to the running of estimations, to the diagnosing of problems, to the presentation of results and to the oral defense of findings.

    :description: This course is designed to introduce students to a wide range of criticisms of modern philosophical and political thought. These critiques are aimed at a variety of modern political phenomena, including progress, liberalism, egalitarianism, historicism, rationalism, scientism, secularism, the rise of privatism and individualism, and the decline of civic life and traditionalism, among others. Moreover, these critiques often resist easy identification with the Right or Left, reflecting the fact that hostility to modernity is shared by many thinkers across the political spectrum, and often for the same reasons. We will explore the meaning of modernity - whether modernity can be understood in any such singular way - and grounds for its critique, as well as the various forms of critique that have been advanced by some of its various opponents. We will explore whether there is a positive political agenda to be detected among such critics, or whether such critique can only be advanced as fundamentally oppositional. Among the authors we will read are Vico, Rousseau, Tocqueville, Heidegger, Arendt, and Strauss, Foucault and MacIntyre. [Political Theory]

    :number: "570"
    :description: This course is a graduate-level survey of post-Soviet Russian politics and issues of post-Communist transitions. It is designed particularly for graduate students in Russian and East European Studies and in the PhD program in comparative politics. The course begins with an examination of the crisis of the USSR in the 1980s and the efforts by Mikhail Gorbachev to respond with a program generally know as "perestroika." The bulk of the semester is devoted to examining the efforts to create a new Russian political system following the demise of the USSR. The Russian experience is analyzed in the context of the more general problem of "transitions" toward more open political and economic systems in former communist settings and in countries that did not have communist governments. Readings include both analyses of Eurasia and Eastern Europe and an introduction to the theoretical and comparative approaches analysts have adopted in studying post-Communism. The course is the second part of a two-semester sequence covering Politics and Society in Russia. While the two courses are designed to complement each other, either course may be taken individually, and the courses may be taken in any order. There are no prerequisites, but students are strongly advised to consult with the instructor about the course and its place in their academic programs.

  - :name: Philosophy of Social Science
    :number: "586"
    :description: The purpose of this course is to introduce graduate students to important philosophical issues within the contemporary theory and practice of social science. Students will begin by reading representative articulations and defenses of what has come to be called the nomological-deductive model of social science, that approach which attempts to structure the study of social life according to a more or less positivistic (and, thus, a controversial) vision of natural science. In exploring these works, part of our concern will be to assess the degrees to which these theoretical formulations extend or depart from the implicit goals of those who, at least remotely, created this perspective, social science theorists (and social scientists) such as John Stuart Mill, Durkheim and Weber. In order to avoid abstraction, this theoretical discussion will be followed by an examination of some major examples within this general social science framework. The works chosen are methodologically sophisticated and each addresses methodological issues explicitly. These works focus on the broad, common theme of political and cultural change. What will follow is an examination of some of the most significant critiques of and alternatives to the (broadly) positivist model. Critical treatments argue (for example) that many of the positivist' goals are either unattainable (e.g., neutrality) or purchasable only at the cost of vacuity or irrelevance (e.g., the elegance and parsimony of theoretical constructions). These criticisms are often accompanied by an alternative posture which argues that the most effective way to understand social and cultural life is through an exploration of the society's or culture's shared meanings. Broadly speaking, this represents the hermeneutical or interpretive approach to social science, an approach that often suggests that we should try to read societies the way we try to read texts. This approach will be examined in three stages. The first stage will consider the basis and nature of the hermeneutical alternative to positivism. This will include a consideration of potential difficulties within the hermeneutic approach, including problems connected with the possibility of generalization, the need for and the possibility of objectivity and neutrality (can hermeneutics be a kind of science) and the possibilities of presenting one set of shared meanings in a different cultural language. The second stage will focus on examples of hermeneutic social science. The final stage will explore the connections between hermeneutics and the more recent language of deconstruction, poststructuralism and postmodernism. Finally, since modern social science in some ways began with a turn away from Aristotle, this course will conclude by considering, briefly, an Aristotelian critique of the two methods.

We then turn to the \"World Revolution of Westernization\" in the 19th and 20th centuries, which laid the foundation for globalization. The major focus is on the \"Third Wave\" of democratization that commenced in the 1970s, the character of transitions in Communist nations, and the relationship of these transitions to processes frequently described as \"globalization.\" We will examine similarities and differences in transitions in different parts of the world, and will attempt to discern the homogenizing and differentiating impact of increasingly interconnected economies, trans-national actors, and new information technologies.

    :description: "This course will examine the challenges countries face as they attempt to emerge from violent conflict or authoritarian rule. To aid in a successful transition, the international community typically engages these countries in the processes of transitional justice, rule-of-law building, and democratization. The course will analyze these transitional processes as they relate to each other as well as to the broader objective of successful transition. First, the course will consider whether democracy can in fact prevent relapse into regimes that violate basic human rights and humanitarian law; whether democracy is reconcilable with diverse cultures and even ethnic hatred. The course will then examine transitional justice including criminal tribunals, truth and reconciliation commissions (TRCs), as well as vetting processes, restitution schemes, and indigenous justice experiments. Country studies will include Sierra Leone, East Timor, the former Yugoslavia, Peru, South Africa, Poland, Rwanda, and Iraq. Students will study the strengths and weaknesses of these mechanisms; the political challenges of implementing international criminal law to the domestic context; and the impact of limited security, timing, and resources. The course will then incorporate rule of law reform and democratization in order to present students with a realistic picture of all the processes, which the international community advances concurrently in transitioning countries. Students will be encouraged to recognize complementarities between these processes. Finally, the course will consider the West\xE2\x80\x99s interests in transition towards democracy, particularly in light of the war on terror and the current United States strategy in the Middle East.

We begin by tracing the rise of the 'liberal modernization' paradigm, as illustrated by the work of Gabriel Almond, G. Powell, Seymour Martin Lipset and Karl Deutsch. We then consider the rise of the "institutionalists," such as Samuel Huntington, and the forging of a 'conservative-traditionalist' approach as evidenced in the work of Clifford Geertz, Howard Wiarda, Lloyd and Susanne Rudolph, Arendt Lijphart and Iliya Harik. We then explore the field of political economy and 'dependency' by focusing on the writings of Guillermo O'Donnell. Finally we analyze 'transitions from authoritarianism' and the politics of economic reform by reading studies by Alfred Stepan, David Collier, Stephen Haggard, Robert Kaufman and Peter Evans. Case studies are drawn from a wide variety of regions and countries including Egypt, Nigeria, Malaysia, India, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, Argentina, and the 'Asian Tigers.' [Comparative Government]

    :description: "This seminar serves as an introduction to the Program in Social and Political Thought. The central purpose of the seminar is to examine and evaluate modern scholars\xE2\x80\x99 efforts to study human beings scientifically. Achieving this purpose will require (1) that we gain a clear understanding of what scientific inquiry is, (2) that we consider what must be true about human beings, as both agents and inquirers, if we are to conclude that the scientific method is the most appropriate way to study human affairs, and (3) that we ask how the scientific study of human affairs furthers and/or hinders our efforts to make sense of our experience as human beings. The course is organized chronologically. Because the leaders of the seventeenth century scientific revolution rebelled self-consciously against the Aristotelian mode of thinking, we will begin by trying to understand how Aristotle thought. After considering several key philosophical issues that lay beneath the scientific revolution, the remainder of the semester will be devoted to examining the writings of four influential social scientists: Adam Smith, William James, Max Weber, and Franz Boas. Critical analysis of these authors\xE2\x80\x99 work will help us grasp the defining preoccupations of the various social scientific disciplines, assess whether practicing social scientists in fact accomplish that to which they aspire, and consider what has been gained and lost in moving the study of human affairs beyond Aristotle."

    :description: "The purpose of this course is to introduce graduate students to important philosophical issues within the contemporary theory and practice of social science. Four positions will be examined: (1) the so-called covering law model of social science, which attempts to structure the study of social life according to a more or less positivistic vision of natural science; (2) the hermeneutical or interpretive approach that focuses on a society's or culture's shared meanings through the construction of narratives; (3) the radical critique of both the theory and practice of social science offered by the interconnected languages of deconstruction, poststructuralism and postmodernism; and (4) an approach that might be called a certain sort of contemporary Aristotelianism. Readings will be drawn from philosophical statements on the epistemology of social science, as well as from the social science disciplines, particularly political science and anthropology. Students will write 2 short (5-8 page) papers focusing on the epistemological dimensions of two works of modern social science (one from the covering law perspective and one from either the hermeneutical or postmodern perspective). One of these papers will be accompanied by an in class presentation. A longer 20-25 page paper on a topic selected in cooperation with the instructor is also required."

    :number: "336"
    :description: "Spring 2006 This seminar focuses on the development of violence during periods of \xE2\x80\x9Cregime change,\xE2\x80\x9D with particular attention being paid to the relationship between political violence and processes of democratization. Over the past 15 years, American foreign policy has been strongly influenced by the idea that the best way to spread peace is to spread democracy. This thinking certainly underwrote the policies of President Bill Clinton, and has been used more recently as a defense for America\xE2\x80\x99s interest in forcing \xE2\x80\x9Cregime change\xE2\x80\x9D in Iraq. Yet, in many instances, the actual period of \xE2\x80\x9Cdemocratization\xE2\x80\x9D has been accompanied by a dramatic increase in levels of sub-state violence. In this course we will look at this conundrum, by addressing the following questions: \xC2\xB7 Does \xE2\x80\x9Cregime change\xE2\x80\x9D or revolution cause domestic-level violence? \xC2\xB7 What kinds of violence develop during regime change? \xC2\xB7 What resolutions to transitional violence might exist? \xC2\xB7 How does violence during \xE2\x80\x9Cregime change\xE2\x80\x9D shape the kind of regime that develops after the period of conflict? The class will be divided into four main thematic areas. We will first look at ideas of the state, revolution and the potential for violent conflict to emerge during large-scale political change -- as articulated in the works of early-modern political theorists. This will be complemented by an overview of contemporary writings on the same topic. The second section of the class focuses on the origins of social violence, broadly speaking, and will examine whether the \xE2\x80\x9Cgreed of elites\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Cgrievances of the masses\xE2\x80\x9D can better account for the outbreak of violent conflict. In the third section, we will look at how countries democratize, the role of external actors (e.g. the USA) in this process, how regime transition may feed into political violence and how transitional violence informs the kind of \xE2\x80\x9Cdemocracy\xE2\x80\x9D that eventuates. The final section of the class will examine the persistence and escalation of political violence in new \xE2\x80\x9Cdemocracies,\xE2\x80\x9D with a particular focus on insurgency and ethnic violence. Rather than concentrating on any one geographic region, the class looks broadly at theoretical treatments of the relationship between regime change and political violence. In support of this conceptual material, we will read about specific cases of transitional violence that have developed over the past 15 years in Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Latin America. The course culminates with your putting together a major research paper, in which you may wish to focus your investigation on a country or region that is of particular interest to you."

The course draws widely from literatures in philosophy, politics, civil society studies, organizational sociology, public administration, and business. Concerns about accountability have garnered increasing societal attention at both domestic and global levels. This course aims to prepare graduate students to think critically about the challenges of accountability that they are likely to face in society, whether they work in the public, private, or nonprofit sectors. Failures of accountability have been most dramatically apparent in the private sector (e.g., Enron Corporation and Arthur Andersen LLP) but also among nonprofit organizations (e.g., the American Red Cross, the United Way of America and The Nature Conservancy). The public sector around the world has also come under increased scrutiny regarding transparency and corruption. The course will help students to frame the debates around accountability in analytical and policy terms, and to develop their own integrated accountability systems."

Field 2: Social Sciences of the Culture and Politics Major exposes students to various approaches to the systematic and comparative study of political and cultural institutions and practices. Major texts of the theoretical framework will be placed in the historical context and familiarize the students with related but often opposing views on the interaction of culture and power. The intent is to provide students with a sound understanding of theory and with an appreciation of the complexity of the field as a precondition for a learned debate. We will study the methodology of various disciplinary approaches as this will help better understand the interdisciplinary analysis essential for the study of culture and politics. Classroom discussions will allow for a critical analysis of the value of different approaches and highlight the significance of culturally deterministic positions in contemporary social theory. Finally, in case studies we will examine culture and power in economic, social and human development."

    :description: This course applies the principles of microeconomics to the study of how healthcare markets work. From this perspective, we will explore why the healthcare system is fractured and what this implies for access to care, the cost of care, and the quality of care. The unique nature of healthcare requires understanding the institutional arrangements that shape and respond to market forces. Market inadequacies and market failures have also resulted in government interventions, which in turn have affected the healthcare market. Perhaps the most unique aspect of healthcare is the role of employer-provided health insurance and the peculiar way in which labor markets are effected. Employer-provided health insurance and healthcare coverage from public programs like Medicare and Medicaid, not only serve as the primary sources of financing healthcare, they have a large role in shaping how care is organized and delivered. Furthermore there are critical gaps in who is covered, what is covered, as well as overlapping coverage that provides perverse incentives for the efficient and effective provision of care. Given the role of public policy, and the relationship between public policies and politics, this course will touch on the relationship between politics, policies, and healthcare markets.

It will then examine how the Aboriginal world intersected with Europe after 1770, when Captain James Cook sailed along the east coast of Australia and claimed the continent for the British Crown. Australian history from this point onwards became intertwined with European and American economies and ideas about class, race, gender, and empire. Twentieth-century topics will include: the idea of citizenship, the effects of the two World Wars and the Depression, post-war immigration, social changes in the 1960s and 1970s, issues of reconciliation with Aboriginal people and of Republicanism in the 1990s, and the forging of national myth and identity.

  - :name: Medieval and early Renaissance Italy
    :number: "102"
    :description: The fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 represents a crucial watershed in the history of European civilization. Nevertheless, the patrimony of ideas of pagan antiquity survives and continues to inspire political and religious beliefs. The course starts with a brief survey of the principal events which shaped this complex period in order to introduce some of the key lines of cultural history of the Middle Ages. A great transformation was later represented by the phenomenon of the re-birth of cities. In fact, around the eleventh century, demographic and economic factors produced a real urban revolution in some areas of Europe, and this turning point actually represents the transition from the feudal system to the late Medieval civilization. The course analyzes the society, the politics and the culture of medieval Italy, focusing mainly on cities from the eleventh to the fifteenth century. The structure of the city-state republic, the family, the daily life, the economy, the religious beliefs and practices, the world of the marginal and the mentality of the people will all be discussed in the effort of reconstructing the features of medieval urban civilization. Particular emphasis will be given to the city of Florence in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The complex city universe expresses itself through a peculiar art and architecture (cathedrals, fresco cycles, city walls and gates, public palaces, altar-pieces, market squares and monasteries) which will be studied in order to reconstruct the material environment and the ideological aspects of late Medieval and early Renaissance Italian civilization. Offered in Fall at the Villa in Fiesole, Italy.

Our geographic scope will take in those regions which today comprise Mongolia, Xinjiang (Eastern Turkestan), Tibet, Afghanistan and the former Soviet Central Asian Republics, and will venture at times into neighboring zones, including Turkey, Russia, Siberia, Iran, India, and China. Needless to say, both the time-frame and geographic area under consideration are very great, but this is justified--indeed, required, by the larger purpose of this course: to highlight ways in which Central Eurasia and its peoples have been central to world history. Linking our examination of particular eras and peoples will be an overarching concern with the dynamics of the relationship between the peoples of the steppes and deserts at the core of the Eurasian continent and the sedentary societies around the rim. We will likewise pay close attention to ways in which political, commercial and cultural linkages across the Eurasian steppe connected Europe, Persia, Mesopotamia and China from times well before the opening of direct maritime communications between Europe and Asia launched the current wave of \"globalization.\" Note: HIST 108 is a regional survey for purposes of Gen Ed and SFS requirements.

    :description: "This is an introductory course on South Asian history intended for students with no prior knowledge of the subject. Working within a broad chronological framework spanning several thousand years, in the lectures, the student will be acquainted with the material, political and socio-cultural formations of the early subcontinental history. Beginning with the Harappan civilization, which was one of the four oldest civilizations of the world, the lectures will trace the development of subcontinental history through the Vedic Age, formation of city-states and monarchies, emergence and decline of the various ancient Empires, the intercivilizational exchange between the Indian subcontinent and the surrounding areas through trade, travel, conquest or cultural exchange, to the subcontinent's passage into the world of the Delhi Sultanate and the Mughal Dynasty. The weekly discussions of this course will be woven around themes such as ancient literary traditions; the significance of inscriptions, archaeology and numismatics; the world of early historical city; orient-gazing in travelers\xE2\x80\x99 accounts; depiction of femininity in religious art; life in the royal courts; the myths of creation in South Asian religions; and the impact of advent of political Islam on the subcontinent, to name a few. Retelling and writing the \xE2\x80\x98past\xE2\x80\x99 in all human societies is as much a creative exercise as it is a political one. This holds true for South Asia more so because not only the British colonists in the nineteenth century but movements with all sorts of political shades right down to the present day have sought to interpret the subcontinent\xE2\x80\x99s ancient and medieval past to suit their own ends. The historians of South Asia have also been as complicit in writing a prejudiced history, which instead of dispelling the stereotyped perceptions, have reinforced them. The central aim of this course therefore is to enable the students to question the picture of South Asia as a land ensconced in mysticism and religion; a society with a timeless and changeless civilization; a region fraught by communal and caste rigidities; and a society that was nudged out of its slumber with the advent of the \xE2\x80\x98West\xE2\x80\x99. Second, in this course the student would be primarily engaging with historical methods and \xE2\x80\x98primary\xE2\x80\x99 sources (such as archaeological data, coins, inscriptions, oral history, literary, poetic and art works). A critical and analytical approach towards the reading of the sources would be encouraged to enable the student to independently arrive at his/her own conclusions. And lastly, by the end of the course the student will be sensitized to the diversity and multiplicity of cultures which constitute the South Asian historical potpourri. This course meets the general education requirement in History for College students when taken in combination with a LATE introductory-level history course (HIST 002, 006, or 034). Offered in Fall."

It will begin with a two week focus on the emergence of women\xE2\x80\x99s and gender history in the second half of the 20th century, acquainting people with just the basic terminology, concepts and theories in the field. Thereafter, it will dig into the history, starting with the emergence of feminist ideas in 18th century Europe and ending with developments up to and immediately following the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. The goal of the course is to give students a solid understanding of this important history, one that will serve them well into later adult life. Though the focus of the course will be on women, we will obviously need to address gender expectations for both men and women. Thus, we will follow the relational history of women and men in chronological order so as to gain a clear idea of this history. There will be a basic textbook for the course, Bonnie Smith\xE2\x80\x99s CHANGING LIVES: WOMEN IN EUROPEAN HISTORY SINCE 1700, along with parallel readings in primary and secondary sources. Parallel books for the course will include Mary Wollstonecraft\xE2\x80\x99s a VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN, John Stuart Mill\xE2\x80\x99s THE SUBJECTION OF WOMEN, George Sand\xE2\x80\x99s INDIANA, John Ruskin\xE2\x80\x99s SESAME AND LILIES, Virginia Woolf\xE2\x80\x99s A ROOM OF ONE\xE2\x80\x99S OWN, and Paula Bartley\xE2\x80\x99s EMMELINE PANKHURST, as well as a couple of similar works for the twentieth century. The remainder of the parallel readings will include fascinating articles or chapters in books. In building the reading list for the course, there has been a concerted effort to find good readings on women (and men) in a variety of different European countries so as to shed light on both the similarities and the differences across the face of Europe.

    :number: "134"
    :description: This course will examine a society and a period of special significance in the history of the British Isles, Europe, and the world. During the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Great Britain--with England at its heart but also including, with increasing prominence, Scotland and Wales--emerged as the global leader in economic enterprise, imperial expansion, and the evolution of resilient and effective political institutions. This was perhaps all the more striking, given that the late-eighteenth century witnessed both within an overseas element of the British Empire and on the continent of Europe the outbreak and progress of two historic revolutions, each of which claimed primacy over British society as a universal model for the conduct of social and political affairs. Accordingly, a comprehensive assessment of British history in this period would be incomplete without reference to Britain's relationship to those great upheavals, one in America, the other in France, and so these events, too, will be covered.

We first examine accounts of his early career, and correct them by close study of how politics worked in the Roman Republic; then look at his time in Gaul and the civil war that followed, both of which he recounted in his own spellbinding prose; and finally the tragedy of his final years, described by friends and supporters after his death. We also consider, more sporadically, later images of Caesar (e.g., in drama, political programs, film, and scholarship), all the while emphasizing that it was Caesar more than anyone else who constructed his own legend. Classes are mostly lectures, but will include some discussion. Students will study a range of contemporary visual material and literature (including all of Caesar\xE2\x80\x99s extant writings), as well as classic papers of leading Roman historians."

  - :name: History of Ireland
    :number: "243"
    :description: The study of Irish history often focuses on the question of what it means to be Irish. This course will engage directly with that question by surveying Irish society and culture from pre-Christian times down to the end of the old Gaelic order in 1607. We will examine Celtic society--its social structure, laws and literature--and then trace its impact on the Christianization of Ireland. We will look at the effect on Ireland of invasions by the Vikings and the Normans, and the establishment of English rule in Ireland. The class emphasizes active learning. Along with traditional lectures, there will be both discussions and structured exercises, with a focus on analyzing primary sources in their historical context. Instructions for in-class discussions and debates will be given in advance. Participation in class discussion is strongly encouraged and constitutes 15% of the course grade. There will also be extensive use of visual materials, including slides, maps and videos.

    :number: "246"
    :description: "This course is the first half of a two-semester sequence that surveys the development of European international relations from the French Revolutionary Wars to the collapse of the Cold War equilibrium. It should be emphasized that this course does not place its main emphasis on exploring the niceties of diplomatic protocol and the tricks of the ambassadorial trade. Rather, the overarching theme we will be addressing concerns the connection between domestic politics and international affairs. How have social, economic, political, and ideological changes within the European Great Powers affected (and been affected by) relations among them? How have conceptions of state interest and approaches to foreign policy been molded and shaped by the French Revolution, the rise of nationalism, industrialization, and democratization? The amount of information encompassed by this topic is, in principle, enormous. We will try and manage the overflow of data in two ways. One involves focussing on the policies of the Great Powers that dominated the international system, rather than spending an equal amount of time on each European country. The second is to explore relatively broad themes and issues through the analysis of selected examples. You will have lectures inflicted upon you on Tuesdays. You are strongly encouraged to raise your hand at any time for questions or comments. Most Thursdays will be devoted to group discussions of the weekly readings. Active participation in class discussions is an integral part of your coursework, and will be an important factor in the calculation of your grades. Grades will be calculated according to the following formula: Class participation: 20% Midterm: 25% Paper: 25% Final exam: 30%"

    :number: "285"
    :description: "Consumer culture is everywhere. Through newspapers, television shows, billboards and the internet, we are constantly bombarded with exhortations to covet and purchase consumer goods which, we are told, will make our lives better. While consumption itself is not a modern phenomenon, the turn of the twentieth century marked a shift from a production to a consumption-based society that ushered in the birth of mass consumerism as we know it today. This course examines the history and theoretical treatments of mass consumerism in North American society from the end of the nineteenth century to the beginning of the twenty-first, with a special focus on the United States example. It will explore how North Americans came to define the \xE2\x80\x9Cgood life\xE2\x80\x9D through consumption, leisure and material abundance. Topics to be covered include the growth of commercialized leisure, the mass production of consumer goods, the emergence of modern advertising and public relations techniques, the relationship between consumers and the state, the growth of the mall as the dominant space for consumption after World War II, the ways in which gender, race, ethnicity and class have shaped responses to the new consumer culture, and the question of ethical limits of consumerism. We will consider the ways ordinary men and women have embraced, shaped, or resisted consumerism through individual choice and collective action. Throughout these topics, we will consider both critiques and champions of consumption. The goal is to arrive at an understanding of the historical roots of contemporary consumer society, and to develop a critical analysis of the current state of that society."

Politics, music, literature, philosophy, theater, art, poetry and the aesthetics will be our guide. The study of African American culture and its interaction with American and world society as a whole will be the mission of this class. We will look at the syncopated rhythms of the African people transferred to American shores by enslaved Africans, starting with the \xE2\x80\x9CNegro Spirituals. Political debates between W.E.B.

We will look at white America\xE2\x80\x99s perception of African Americans and analyze how these ideas were formed and why they continue to exist and why they persist. We will look at the major intellectual, cultural, and performance arts during the Harlem Renaissance (performers such as Paul Robeson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Marian Anderson, and Bessie Smith). We will watch films and film clips of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Miles Davis and Thelonius Monk. We will also listen to the music of people who have been influenced by major Black artists. The role of artists and painters like Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence, and stage and theater performers like Lena Horne will also be reviewed. The roles and images of Blacks in films will be analyzed. We will also review poetry, literature, and the sports.

To others, the Civil War set whole new revolutions in motion, some of which remain incomplete. In either interpretation, the war overturned institutions, political habits, and the role of government for everyone in the nation. For those who lived in the southern half of the nation, the war abruptly eliminated the basic social structure that defined and ordered every aspect of life, and turned the single greatest source of wealth in the entire nation, slaves, into free men and women. The aftermath of the war presented the problem and the opportunity of doing nothing less than remaking society, and at war\xE2\x80\x99s close some Americans hoped that the Federal government would dedicate itself to doing just that.

This colloquium will study the ways that people of different religious, cultural, and racial backgrounds dealt with diversity.

We will examine some of the philosophical and religious theories of tolerance and persecution, but primarily we will focus on the practical aspects of toleration\xE2\x80\x93how ordinary people were either able to live with diversity or chose to persecute those with seemingly threatening religious and/or cultural systems. Because religious difference was the primary motivation for persecution in the early modern period, as well as the primary focus of those who advocated toleration, the course will focus in large part on the relationship of different religious groups to one another: Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Muslims. Another hot-button issue of the early modern period was witchcraft; we will analyze how and why marginal individuals in society were systematically accused of and prosecuted for witchcraft. We will also examine the way that theories of tolerance developed as a result of the opening of the Atlantic World and the European encounter with Africans and Native Americans.

Each course will be announced in the course schedule and receive its own sub-title. In Fall 2006 the following course is offered: Mexico: Agrarian revolution to modern nation. Students of this course will discuss and understand the most important historical processes that shaped the transition from a predominantly agrarian society to an urban-industrial one in 20th-century Mexico. They will also analyze how this transition occurred in the context of changing relations between the national state and the most important social and economic actors, giving the foundation for different models of important development: an enclave economy during the Porfiiato, agrarianism in the aftermath of the Mexican revolution, Import Substitution Industrialization after the 1930s, and economic liberalization from the 1980s onward. Above all, this course aims at providing students with analytical tools to engage the complexity of historical developments and transitions that have characterized modern Mexico. Themes will include Mexico's insertion into international trade, agrarianism, cultural transformations, rural-urban immigration, educational modernization, the consolidation of the middle class, Mexico's relationship with the United States, and economic liberalization. Students will be evaluated through three papers and class participation. In Spring 2007 the following course is offered: The Amazon: Between Eden and Wasteland. This course will examine the dynamics between man and the environment in the Amazon from pre-historic times to the present, with an emphasis on Brazil. The class is designed to attract students from many disciplines by exploring the Amazon from historical, literary, environmental and anthropological perspectives. Selected readings and films will examine cultural constructions of Amazonians, e.g., noble savages, cannibal Indians, extravagant rubber barons, destructive settlers. The class will examine the Amazon as a frontier society, where the presence of the State is weak, and the interests of Indians, settlers, environmentalists, miners and developers collide and lead to conflict. The class will study four periods: Part I: controversies over the population size, complexity, and human transformations of Amazonian society before European conquest. Part II: the devastating impact of conquest and colonization on indigenous societies from the 16th century to the mid-19th century. Part III: the Amazon rubber boom (1850-1912), which transformed the Amazon into a producer for the world economy, stimulated migrations, and created cities in the rainforest. Part IV: 20th century State-led efforts to develop and colonize the Amazon and the resistance organized by indigenous groups, environmentalists, rubber tappers and international supporters to contest predatory development."

The explanation is not obvious: is dictatorship somehow endemic to the region; is it a necessary consequence of Islam or of established patterns of behavior; is democracy impossible? To answer these questions, this course will consider the historical background of the region and study the rise, careers and (where appropriate) fall of individual dictators. It will focus on the central Islamic lands, especially Egypt, Turkey and Iran, as well as Syria and Libya, with a brief survey of other countries of the region, with or without dictators. This is a colloquium, not a lecture course; it will require active student participation. For each class, a discussion leader will be chosen, to present the main topic and associated questions.

    :description: "The end of a century and the beginning of a new one can be a moment of self-consciousness, when people pause in their usual activities to reflect on the direction of their civilization and to wonder what the future might hold. Usually, the 1917 Revolution dominates our consciousness of the first decades of the 20th century in Russia. This course offers a chance to take an in-depth look at a different aspect of Russian life: the turbulent world of ideas and culture, in many ways shared with other European capitals, that we have come to know as the Silver Age. One of the great novels of the age, Andrei Bely's Petersburg, will be our window into the artistic currents, philosophical discussions, apocalyptic moods and revolutionary stirrings of turn-of-the-century Russia. Since the creators of the Silver Age thought of themselves as drawing on the whole of Russian and world culture for inspiration, I also hope that our focus on these 30 years will propel us both backwards and forwards in time so we can discuss broad themes of Russian history and culture."

    :number: "385"
    :description: The history of the American West is more than just cowboys and Indians. In fact, the nineteenth- and twentieth-century American West was one of the most diverse places on the planet. In addition to hundreds of distinct and unique American Indian cultures, the West was also home to immigrants from all over the world, from China to Finland to Chile. It was also a place where notions of masculinity and femininity, and the relationships between men and women, were constantly in flux and turmoil. As diverse men and women laid railroads, dug for gold, logged forests, built farms and cities, and raised families, they clashed over what place they would occupy in this new world. This course examines how ideas about gender and race shaped the creation of the modern American West. Readings will include both primary and secondary sources. In addition to short papers, an independent research paper will be required.

From 1820 to 1860, the South dominated the nation politically, economically, and culturally, and it did so primarily thanks to the institution of slavery. When both the dominance and the institution of slavery began to look insecure, eleven states in the South broke away to form the Confederacy. As we examine the South from 1820 to 1865, we will be interested in the lives of white, black, and Native American Southerners. Our themes will include politics and ideology, capitalism and the market, class conflict, gender roles, slavery and violence, and the central place of race within the history of the South. Broad questions guiding our semester will include: What made the southern states in the nineteenth-century United States The South? What was southern about it, and what was American about it? In short, we will ask, was the South, with all its contradictions, conflict, and diversity, an exception to U.S. history, or at the heart of U.S. history from 1820 to 1865?"

The central issue it addresses concerns the vexed relationship between ethnic and civic conceptions of nationalism. How does the myth of common ancestry interact with the idea of civic culture in the construction of national identities? Are the ideas of kinship and citizenship fundamentally at odds with each other, or is their synthesis in fact a vital element in the creation of a cohesive polity? Does ethnic nationalism necessarily generate intolerance, or can it be reconciled with pluralistic values? Are these problems specific to any particular culture and historical era, or are they universal? We will grapple with these sorts of broad questions by looking both at theoretical works drawn from a variety of disciplines and at historical case studies. While this course focuses largely on modern Europe, a couple of readings go beyond that continent\xE2\x80\x99s confines. Students are also free to choose paper topics that deal with non-European parts of the world.

We will look at their perceptions of the problem in the period approximately of 1789 to 1939, and at the anxieties, fantasies, and solutions they proposed.

  - :name: Food in European History
    :number: "449"
    :description: "During the Renaissance, the foods and cuisines of Europe bore a strong family resemblance to their counterparts in late Roman antiquity and the Muslim cultures of the medieval world. Cereals dominated the diet and the prevailing culinary style favored complex, spicy sauces. Wine was the universal beverage of choice, distilled spirits were rare, and coffee, tea, and other caffeinated drinks were unknown. Medical advice about diet and health drew on the teachings of Hippocratic medicine (which originated in ancient Greece) as expanded and amended by Roman and Arab physicians. Shortly after 1500, however, this picture began to change, laying the foundations of the dietary and culinary regimes with which we are familiar today. This course will examine the transformation of the habits of cooking, eating, and drinking in Europe between 1500-1900 with an emphasis on France and England. Topics will include: the reception of new foods from the Americas; the growing availability and popularity of sugar and colonial beverages (coffee, tea, and chocolate); the uneven impact of economic growth on the diets of rich and poor Europeans; changing ideas about diet, health, and disease; changing manners and patterns of social behavior associated with food and drink; the rise of the restaurant, and the emergence of modern culinary styles, including national ones."

Have Europeans successfully resisted or domesticated what America exported? And how does Americanization relate to modernization? To Globalization? Are either modernization or Globalization superior analytical categories for this process? Most important, what does this transformation mean? Is it something to regret or to applaud? For example should we be concerned about global homogenization via the \xE2\x80\x9CAmerican way\xE2\x80\x9D and the loss of diversity?

Sebald\xE2\x80\x99s assertion in his provocative essay Literatur und Luftkrieg of 1999 that Germans had repressed the memory of their own suffering after defeat in 1945. From a different perspective, J\xC3\xB6rg Friedrichs in his volume Brand. Deutschland im Bombenkrieg 1940 - 1945 presents a similar case from the perspective of a non-academic historian. To some extent, both publications laid claim to an interpretive context for the bombings of Hamburg, Dresden, N\xC3\xBCrnberg and other German cities that had long been the dominion of right wing extremists such as the historian David Irving. As a steady flow of publications in both English and German demonstrates, the debates stirred by Sebald\xE2\x80\x99s and Friedrich\xE2\x80\x99s publications were not short-lived media events but seem to have struck a cord with longer lasting reverberations.

    :description: This course will analyze some of the central themes in American women's history from the early republic to the late twentieth century. It will consider the different ways historians have approached the writing of women's history and encourage students to think critically about historical arguments and the difference that gender makes in our interpretation of the past. A central theme of the course will be to understand how women's experiences have differed across lines of class, race, ethnicity, geographic location and sexuality. Issues to be covered include the ideology of separate spheres, women's activism in reform movements, the evolution of the struggle for political equality, slavery, the relationship between domestic and paid work, sexuality and reproduction, consumption, civil rights, and the modern feminist movement. Readings will be drawn from both primary and secondary sources and will reflect the diversity of perspectives that define American women's history.

  - :name: Religion and the State in Western Europe
    :number: "333"
    :description: The role of religion in the political sphere is a matter of great moment in today's world. This course examines the historical evolution of the relationship between Church and State beginning in the Medieval World and moving into the Modern World, up to and including modern-day Christian fundamentalism. We begin with the moment that the Roman Empire became an officially Christian empire and then look at the evolving relationship of the papacy toward political power. By the thirteenth century the papacy had gone far toward becoming a papal monarchy over Christian Europe. We will then examine a variety of radical responses to a politicized papacy as well as the impact that the Protestant Reformation had on religious politics. Of particular interest are emerging ideas of the separation of Church and State and the novel concept of religious toleration. The last few weeks of the course focus on political writings from seventeenth and eighteenth-century Europe (most notably John Locke), the role of religion in the founding of the American Republic, and the political significance of Christian fundamentalism today.

  - :name: Romantics and Revolutionaries in Nineteenth-Century Europe
    :number: "335"
    :description: Romantics and revolutionaries in nineteenth-century Europe typically get little attention in survey courses. Yet Romanticism and the revolutionary spirit of the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries represent what historian Isaiah Berlin has called "the greatest single shift in the consciousness of the West that has [ever] occurred." This course is devoted to exploring that shift in breadth and depth. It will take a whirlwind tour--Byronic in nature--of the great revolutionaries and Romantics of the day. It will provide an in-depth understanding of animators such as Robespierre, Danton, and the little-known but enormously important Filippo Michele Buonarroti--"the first professional revolutionary in Europe." We will examine the Carbonari who were to be found in almost every European country at the time, and the students who joined the burschenscaften or became Young Hegelians. Mazzini, Garibaldi, Blanqui and the like will be our companions during the semester. Revolutionaries and Romantics had much in common, and to understand their goals and energy the course will tour not only the political landscape, but also the contemporary cultural, socioeconomic and artistic realms. We will read from Wordsworth and Michiewicz, Gioberti, Pushkin, Jane Austen, and even the Marquis de Sade. The art, architecture, and music of the day will also be necessary stops on our tour. And the great heroes and cult figures of the day, from Franz Liszt to Chopin to George Sand and Jenny Lind, "the Swedish Nightingale"--as well as all those young men who rushed off to help the Greeks in their War of Independence--will be on the crowded stage.

We will also look at the ways that medieval people reacted to saints and the role that devotion to the saints played in medieval culture. We will study how medieval people honored their saints (and sometimes defamed them) and what was expected from saints in return; what kinds of people became recognized saints, and how this recognition happened (or failed to happen); and what sort of stories were told about saints and how this hagiography took on enormous cultural importance. We will be examining popular (and unusual) practices regarding saints, such as the treatment of saints\xE2\x80\x99 corpses, as well as the development of the juridical process that led to canonization.

  - :name: Magic Science and Religion in Europe
    :number: "347"
    :description: In this colloquium we will explore the relationship of official religion to magic, approaches to the study of the natural world, and healing practices in Western Europe from late antiquity to the Scientific Revolution in the seventeenth century. Although the course will concentrate on ideas and events in Western Europe, important points of interaction between Christian and Islamic worlds will be taken up (the practice of alchemy, after all, received its name in the Arab world). Relying on historical documents and other evidence, we will place varieties of magic and superstition in historical context. Throughout the course we will examine underlying assumptions about God, the supernatural, the preternatural, and the natural. Because the role of superstition and magic receded -- but did not completely disappear -- by the seventeenth century, the course will address the reasons why much of what was normal and normative from antiquity to the Middle Ages became marginalized by the seventeenth century. At the same time, neither Christianity nor early modern science was intrinsically hostile to forms of magic; instead, both incorporated it in positive ways during their formative years. It is precisely this paradoxical combination of faith and reason on the one hand, and unreason on the other, that we will seek to understand in the course.

The aim of this course is to familiarize students with the political mind of early modern Europeans, and to discover the many possible meanings of political liberty and tyranny. Based on a variety of case-studies and the reading of primary sources and literature, you will learn that democracy as we know it today is not the only political system concerned with the idea of liberty, and that democratic freedom has not always been the obvious solution to political problems. We will ground our discussions in historical examples drawn from Ancient Greece, the Roman Empire, Renaissance Italy, and early modern Europe. The last class will place our debate about liberty and tyranny in the context of today\xE2\x80\x99s United States. Although the controversy about the surveillance policies of the National Security Agency may die down, the fundamental issues it raises will remain. The ultimate intention is to stimulate reflection upon the nature and purpose of government, and the place and meaning that liberty should have in politics.

This course will examine recent Latin American dictatorships and democracies and assess the effectiveness of various groups to express. The central question we will ask is: what does citizenship mean for groups that have not fully benefited from the promises of democracy? What are their demands? What strategies have grass-roots groups used to achieve their goals? What constrains have they faced? What less ons can be drawn from each case? Can these lessons be applied to other contexts?

Rather than concentrating on the demographic and economic factors contributing to the rapid emergence of urban poverty as one of the region's most notable characteristics, we will analyze primarily the ways in which successive generations of intellectuals and reformers have considered this problem. We begin with a contrast between recent market-based and radical propositions, and then leap backwards to formulations of the culture of poverty in the 1950s, working our way forward again through marxist structuralism, the freedom to build movement, and the emergence of global thinktank approaches to urban policy. The goals are deeper understanding of the changing nature of urban marginalization and firmly grounded historical perspective on ongoing policy debates. The reading load is substantial. Assignment consist primarily of one presentation, brief weekly response papers, and a final historiographical paper.

The approach is broadly comparative, and will discuss classic problems such as: what is the nature of the connection between modernization and nationalism? What is the relationship between civic and ethnic conceptions of nationhood? Did East European nationalism develop in a manner that contrasts clearly with West European models, or are these cultural stereotypes completely misleading? How does nationalism evolve from intellectual movement to mass movement, and what impact does this shift have on its ideological content? Although the geographical focus of most assigned readings is on modern Europe, students are encouraged to write their term papers on any region and time period they are interested in, as long as the theme is connected to nationhood and nationalism.

While we will read scholarly works of history, theory and cultural criticism, substantial amounts of time will be spent working together to develop analyses of popular culture \xE2\x80\x9Cstuff.\xE2\x80\x9D Students will then undertake their own analysis of an object of popular culture and tell a story about that analysis using new media. (See this site about digital stories for one form we will adapt.) Although the course will center on the development of historically-informed analyses, we will consider a variety of theoretically-informed perspectives (for instance, textual analysis, audience analysis or theories of the carnivalesque). We will undertake these analyses collectively, ranging widely across a great diversity of American popular culture artifacts since World War II (such as, film, cartoons, dancing, television and music). Questions this course will address include: What meaning does popular culture communicate? What theoretical perspectives can aid in understanding that meaning? How has American popular culture changed over the last half-century? How has the development of new technologies opened new avenues of popular culture and foreclosed old ones? In what senses is popular culture \xE2\x80\x9Cpopular\xE2\x80\x9D? In what senses is it predetermined?"

It is either the scorched earth of bitter religious strife or the quaint home of Riverdance, where no one is ever more than five feet from their next creamy pint of Guinness. In this class we will examine the cultural, social, economic and political development of modern Ireland from the establishment of a Protestant ascendancy in the 17th century to the introduction of the Euro in 2002. Along the way, we will encounter a diversity of Irish experiences. We\xE2\x80\x99ll sift through the documentary evidence of a potato blight transformed into a brutal famine through a combination of indifference and calculation. We\xE2\x80\x99ll examine the struggle of a world-renown author trying to free himself from the intellectual constraints of an increasingly uncompromising Irish nationalism. We\xE2\x80\x99ll witness the transformation of a disinterested medical student into a violent revolutionary by Britain\xE2\x80\x99s brutal response to the Easter Rising.

Among the issues we will study are: the social functions of different types of music (sacred, instrumental, vocal, etc.) and theater (comic, tragic, popular, courtly, etc.); the social status of musicians and theater artists; musical and theater patronage; the audiences for different types of music and theater; music publishing and the practice of music by amateurs; the relationship between elite and popular music and theater; the place of music and theater within the culture of each age; and the varieties of theater and music styles. The stress will be on western Europe. The lectures will be mainly devoted to music issues, while most of the discussions will address developments in theater.

  - :name: African societies after slavery
    :number: "311"
    :description: "This course will focus on the comparative transformations from societies largely dependent on slavery to post-emancipation forms of labor. The focus will be on what was known in the 19th and most of the 20th centuries as British Colonial Africa and the British West Indies. We will examine the social, economic, cultural, and political issues involved as societies were transformed by emancipation from a slave labor system to a \xE2\x80\x98free labor\xE2\x80\x99 system. Students will read primary sources written by colonial officials, missionaries, African independent churches and political leaders, and former slave communities concerning the conflicts over how the post-emancipation society would be ordered. Protests and rebellions by former slaves, contract laborers, and apprentices will be examined for their role in shaping political cultures in specific societies. Fundamental issues concerning property rights, citizenship, gender relations, religious freedom and cultural expressions will be examined within the context of ethnically and racially diverse societies in Africa and the West Indies. The role of South Asian, Chinese, Creole, and African cultures in defining the political and cultural identity of post-emancipation societies will be examined through literature, music, and performance. Case studies will involve examples from Jamaica, Barbados, British Guiana (Guyana), Trinidad, and the Bahamas as well as southern and northern Nigeria, the Gold Coast (Ghana), Zanzibar, the Sudan, Uganda, and the Cape Colony in South Africa. No prerequisites required, although students should have a genuine willingness to read primary historical documents and other materials related to these social transformations."

    :number: "314"
    :description: "The term \"high-life\" is most often associated with a musical style originating in Ghana and Sierra Leone in the 1920s and popular to the present day. The music mixed the sounds of American, European, and Caribbean influences within African musical traditions. Just like the music, African urban life has been a mixture of Western notions of town planning, architecture, and politics with African cultural and interpersonal traditions. The history of the African city offers a useful lens into the complicated and creative mixture of African and global sources. This course will focus on this mixing over the 20th century, concentrating on cities such as Harare, Zimbabwe; Accra, Ghana; Dakar, Senegal; Lagos, Nigeria; Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and Nairobi, Kenya. The history of segregation in Johannesburg and Cape Town, South Africa will also be examined. Students interested in Foreign Service or Africa-related employment will be given a chance to explore the historical foundations of the problems of today's cities: unemployment, environmental degradation, the HIV-AIDs epidemic, and the failure of African states and urban development projects from the perspective of colonial and postcolonial history. A key area of investigation will be the historical difficulties confronting municipal governments, states, foreign donors and NGOs in taking on African urban projects. At the same time, the positive cultural and material achievements of urban dwellers will be explored through music, film, and fiction, including the development of unique musical traditions, the explosion of new religious organizations and communities, and the common themes of urban life expressed in African literature. This term we will also give greater focus to Dakar, Dar es Salaam and Cape Town as many students will be getting ready to live there or will be returning from their trips. In addition, more effort this term will be made to combine urban history and urban theory for students working on topics of urban development, health, and donor/government issues. Spring."

  - :name: The Mongol World
    :number: "324"
    :description: Before European expansion, the only comparable old world unification was the Mongol empire, which formed a bridge between Europe, Islam and East Asia in the 13th century. Though the Mongols are best known for chilling military efficacy, their legacy properly includes transcontinental exchanges of goods, technology, cultural material and geographic knowledge, as well as a lasting system of political legitimacy and imperial organization in Asia and a tantalizing glimpse of Cathay that spurred later Europeans on to exploration and conquest. Through readings, discussion, and viewing of cultural artifacts, this course considers the world the Mongols made and reflects upon its contribution to the world we know today. Primary readings will be drawn from The Secret History of the Mongols, the travel accounts of Marco Polo and of Ibn Battuta, the histories of Juvaini and Rashid al-Din, missionary accounts of Carpini, Rubruck and Rabban Sauma, and other texts.

In the last 150 years, Korea has undergone several transformations\xE2\x80\x94from a relatively isolated, self-contained Confucian kingdom to the setting of imperial rivalries in the 19th century, a land colonized by the Japanese empire, occupied by Soviet and American military forces, the site of the first international conflict after World War II, and a remarkable economic and political success story in the 20th century. The course will study the impact of these historical processes on Korean state and society, particularly the consequences of imperialism, colonialism, decolonization, Communism, war, rapid economic development, and democratization. The central question throughout will be how Koreans conceived and articulated ideas of what it meant to be Korean in a modern world. Spring."

Intervening topics include medieval heresy, civil suppression of heresy, judicial torture, and the Inquisition. Throughout the course, we will be attempting to define and understand historically such western concepts as social consensus, right authority, tradition, dissent, and heterodoxy. We will also be investigating the role that ideological uniformity plays in social cohesion and the extent to which opposition to orthodoxy is not merely to set oneself in opposition to civil and religious authorities, but also to a whole culture.

    :description: "This number will be used for colloquia devoted to specific subjects in the area of Middle East history. Students may take more than one of the courses offered under this number. Each course will be announced in the course schedule and receive its own sub-title. In Fall 2005 the following course is offered: Conservative Islam in the twentieth century: Throughout the twentieth century, Muslim scholars and activists across the Islamic world have chosen different ways of coping with the rapid changes brought about by modernity. While Islamic modernism and political Islam are possibly the most well known responses, this class is about a third one. The basic premise of conservative Islam is that religion does not need to be adapted or reinterpreted; it simply needs to be understood and practiced properly, that is, like the Prophet, his companions, and the imams of the first three generations of Islamic history understood and practiced it. The proponents of conservative Islam are not revolutionary, nor do they strive for the establishment of an Islamic state. They rather issue fatwas, focus on correct beliefs and proper devotional behavior, and endeavor to draw a clear border between what is Islamic and what is not. During the course, we will examine the ideas, significance, and evolution of this school of thought, while trying to understand how conservative Islam is different from both Islamic modernism and political Islam, and why it has gained ground in the past two decades. Some of our weekly themes will emphasize its pre-modern origins, its various manifestations, its relation to Wahhabism in Saudi Arabia, and its more recent radicalization."

    :description: "This course offers an introduction to the environmental history of the Americas from the depths of pre-history to our own times. It begins with a synoptic look at the long stretch of time running from the age of dinosaurs to our own geological epoch, and then concentrates on three eras of dramatic environmental change: the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, when Native Americans first encountered Europeans and Africans along the shores of the western Atlantic; the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, when colonialism, the rise of global markets, industrialization and increasing urbanization recast the ecology and culture of much of the western hemisphere; and the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, when new energy regimes, massive population growth and an emerging ecological awareness, among other factors, thrust the natural world into political and social consciousness. In each of these eras, we will focus on the ways in which shifting human activities, cultural patterns, and ecological dynamics contributed to the overall patterns of environmental change. One goal of the course will be to provide an historical context for understanding many of our current environmental problems and issues. Since the literature is much more developed for North America than for Central and South America, North America will receive more attention in this course. We will, though, strive to place developments within a hemisphere-wide context. Topics will include Native Americans, colonialism, disease and demography, agriculture, urbanization, energy, biodiversity, natural resource use, waste, changing views of the natural world, and the conservation and environmental movements.

The ideas of David Walker, Frederick Douglass W.E.B. DuBois and their contemporaries will be studied. Theories of European philosophers like Kant, Hume, Huthcheson, Montesquieu and others of the Enlightenment will be explored as will theories on Race and racial identity. We will also look at ideas of African and Caribbean leaders whose works have had tremendous influences on African Americans. Among those will be C.L.R.

    :description: "The Jacksonian era broadly defined (approximately 1815-1854) marked an era of astonishing change and dramatic contrasts in U.S. history. Within a single generation, the market revolution transformed the American economy, a democratic revolution transformed its political structure into a two-party system that continues to dominate today, and the Second Great Awakening swept across the social and cultural landscape. The age called Americans\xE2\x80\x99 most basic notions into question, redefining everything from how a government should work to what it meant to be a man or a woman. It also created notions we take for granted today, such as the idea of a middle class. It heightened conflicts while embedding the institution of slavery so deeply into the foundation of the nation that nothing short of fratricidal war could resolve those conflicts. It witnessed the systematic removal of whole peoples from their homes, and it set the wheels of continental expansion in motion. And all the while, many Americans genuinely saw their nation as a land of unbounded promise and opportunity for common people. This semester, we will consider what we are to make of the paradoxes of the Jacksonian age, and what they continue to mean for us today. Spring."

Many scholars of Africa have argued that the concepts of gender and generation are key to understanding Africa's political, legal and economic history. Using case studies from around the continent, we will consider how ideologies of gender and generation have been created in Africa and how they have been challenged or perpetuated in the colonial and post-colonial periods.

    :description: This course will explore the intercultural relations of Asians and Europeans from 1550 to 1800. It is intended for the student seeking to learn about Europeans actively engaged in Asia as travelers, traders or missionaries and the Asian viewpoint of Europeans in that setting. The Portuguese opening of trade with and the arrival of missionaries in India eventually led to their further expansion to Southeast Asia, Japan, and China. Other Europeans as the Spanish, the English, the Dutch, and the French followed in their footsteps. Within a few decades items from China made their way to India and articles produced in both of these countries were brought to Brazil. Global, no longer just regional, interchange was emerging. With it came the exchange of ideas about other peoples, such as Voltaire usually writing positively about China in his "Essai sur les moeurs," and Montesquieu doing the opposite in his The Spirit of the Laws. Moreover, European outreach to Asia led to the first efforts in writing world history. These are some of the themes explored in the assigned readings that are only a survey of the extensive literature in English. Spring.

One often finds clear evidence of a "battle of the sexes," although the conflict is sometimes relatively low-keyed (as in women's struggle for equal access to education), or alternately strident (as in the quest for women's suffrage in England).

It is part the history of doctrinal development, the ways in which Islamic jurists, working with received texts and sophisticated methodologies, formulated rules about women, men, and their relationships. It is part the history of legal institutions and practices, how these rules were understood, implemented, and even modified by a range of legal actors, from individual judges to centralized state powers. It is also part the history of lay members of Muslim communities whose choices of doctrines to follow and legal avenues to pursue allowed the law to develop in rhythm with social needs, just as their legal inquiries and court appearances also served, at times, as contestation of legal discourse on women and gender issues. We look at the historical evolution of basic legal doctrines, the range of legal practices in the Ottoman and modern (19th and 20th centuries) periods, and end with an examination some of the heated legal issue of today.

In "real life," however, interactions among people, linguistic communicties, and cultures frequently cut across political divisions. Water - rivers, stream, seas - is often an invitation to settlement, commerce, and conquest. This course offers a look (inspired in part by Fernand Braudel's _Mediterranean_) at a body of water -the Black Sea - and the lands around it, in sweeping historical perspective. Focus is on those moments when the various civilizations and empires that originated and flourished around the Black Sea met and intersected in friendship or in enmity. Ancient civilizations, Greek colonization, Byzantine-Slav interactions, the period of Ottoman dominance, Russian-Turkish rivalry, and decolonization and wars in the 19th and 20th centuries.

    :number: "855"
    :description: "The purpose of this course is to provide a balanced and a dynamic understanding of the complex question of religion and ethnicity in the most important Islamic empire of the early modern and modern era. The course takes a close look at a number of large issues such as the long history, transformation and changing nature of Islam in the Ottoman Empire, the use of Islam in the imperial ideology, the question of Islamization and conversion, and the role of and tension between orthodox Islam and Islamic mysticism of the dervish orders. The often controversial views of the secondary literature regarding tolerance and intolerance in Islamic polities, as well as the dhimmi, that is, the non-Muslims in Islamic societies will be compared and contrast with the experience of the various Jewish and Christian communities in the Ottoman Empire. In this regard, the coexistence, symbiosis and confrontation of various religious groups in the empire, the changing status of Ottoman religious minorities and their relationship with the European powers, the history of the Greek and the Slavic Orthodox Churches, the rise and role of the Phanariots, the Ottomans\xE2\x80\x99 attitudes and policy toward Catholicism and Protestantism, as well as the integration of Ottoman Ashkenazi, Karaite, Romaniote, and Sephardic Jewry into the Ottoman economy and society will be examined.

  - :name: Immunology
    :number: "209"
    :description: The field of immunology studies how the body distinguishes between what is self and what is non-self. Although we are accustomed to thinking about immunology with respect to pathogens and disease, the function of the immune system in fighting microbes is really a manifestation of its fundamental role as a system whereby the body knows itself. Throughout our lives, the immune system gathers and interprets information about the body. When something is not right, whether it is due to a microbial pathogen, or traumatic tissue damage, or cells growing abnormally to become a tumor, or the presence of transplanted foreign tissue, our immune system is activated to try to restore homeostasis. When it malfunctions it contributes to disease. In this course, we will learn the basic principles governing the functioning of the human immune system. The first few lectures will refer to the immune response to microbial infections. Defense against infection was the first function of the immune system to be recognized and is the best understood. Infection makes a story that has a beginning, middle, and end, and you should be able to tell that story about half way through the course. Once we learn how the cells and molecules work together to fight infection, we will then be able to consider them with regard to allergens, venoms, blood transfusions, tissue transplants, autoimmune diseases, cancer, immunodeficiency and vaccinations.

High altitude mountain, deep-sea diving and isolated low temperature polar environments are other extreme environments that can result in profound alterations in human physiology and in severe pathology. Some of the adaptations are mostly uncomfortable and/or annoying. Others, however, can lead to severe dysfunction and even death. This course explores changes in muscle, bone, cardiovascular, neurological and behavioral functioning among others that occur in response to living and working in extreme environments. Some of the efforts will be highlighted that are made or are under development to prevent or treat harmful adaptations at these new frontiers for environmental and for occupational health and medicine.

How does one define happiness? What is a (or the) good life? How is romantic passion related to happiness and personal freedom? Finally, how do these authors perceive the role of society, gender, national identity, and religion within this complex equation, and how do those issues interact with the genre of the novel and the adultery plot?

During this course through lectures, museum visits, and field trips, we will consider \xE2\x80\x9Cthe politics of Christian art,\xE2\x80\x9D that is the transformations and symbological evolutions that result from new styles of governance or society, i.e., the imaging of Christ as Emperor following the declarations of Christianity as the religion of the Roman Imperium; or from the promulgation of official Church doctrines, i.e., the evolution of the Virgin Mary from simple maiden into the Theotokos as a result of the decrees of the Council of Ephesus. This new style of \xE2\x80\x9Creading\xE2\x80\x9D Christian art will provide insights not only in the visual culture of Christianity but of the interconnections between art, culture, politics, and religion throughout the history of western Christianity. Course lectures/discussions will begin with a consideration of the symbological values present in Simone Martini\xE2\x80\x99s innovative depiction of The Annunciation. Class lectures and discussions will concentrate on \xE2\x80\x9Cthe politics of Christian art\xE2\x80\x9D through a chronological survey of Christian art from the 2nd/3rd-century catacombs and sarcophagi in Rome to the 5th/6th-century mosaics in Ravenna to Medieval manuscripts and cathedral architecture to such Florentine Renaissance masterpieces as Donatello\xE2\x80\x99s sculptures of David and Judith, Michelangelo\xE2\x80\x99s sculptures for the Medici Chapel Tombs.

  - :name: "Intro to Culture and Politics: Humanities"
    :number: "043"
    :description: "The course aims to introduce students to the major theoretical paradigms of the politics of culture, and apply them to specific cultural texts and artifacts. The course is based on three main premises: first of all, that all culture is political, if by political we understand the relationship of a work of art to the social order and flows of power. Its intentions and effects can range all the way from affirming to questioning, subverting, transgressing, or protesting prevailing national, class, racial, and gender relations, to name the most pertinent axes of difference. We will ask why some artists explicitly position themselves a nonpolitical, and look at why, and how, some cultural objects obscure political power relations, and others aim to expose them. The objective is to become more conscious and sensitive to how culture positions us vis-\xC3\xA0-vis political power. The second premise is that there is no \xE2\x80\x9Cobjective,\xE2\x80\x9D disinterested stance one can take up, as a scholar, student, or consumer, vis-\xC3\xA0-vis culture, since we are all enmeshed in symbolic systems rather than standing outside of them. Indeed, many of us participate in multiple, sometimes antagonistic cultures, and the ability to translate between them becomes increasingly important, indeed indispensable, to global citizens. The third premise is that there is not a single theory of culture that explains all cultural texts, artifacts, and performances, and how people interact with them. Just as it is valuable to acquire fluency in different local/national/class/gendered etc. cultures, fluency in different theories of culture will enhance our aesthetic appreciation and critical faculties. We will therefore survey and investigate different definitions (aesthetic, anthropological, semiotic), registers (mass, popular, high, avant-garde), and genres (print, visual, performance) of culture."

    :description: "Spring 2007 Medieval Literatures and Culture This course will consider three aspects of cultural formation in medieval societies: ideology, violence, and gender. Why these three? Each of them is a prominent subject of literary study today in all periods, as is \"cultural formation\" itself, and all of them are important subjects of investigation in other disciplines, such as anthropology, psychology, sociology, and social history, which continue to affect, to broaden, and to interact with the study of literature. Our focus will be on two cultures in medieval Europe, which we will attempt to treat comparatively. The first is Nordic or Viking culture of the 8th to the 11th centuries, encompassing the peoples of Scandinavia, Iceland, and (after the Danish invasions) England. We will begin with Nordic mythology and religion from Snorri Sturlusson's Prose Edda: the Nordic creation story of fire and ice, the world-ash Yggdrasil, the encircling world-serpent Jormungandr, the war of the gods and the giants, Thor, Oden, and Loki. Then we will read several Icelandic sagas from the Viking period-Njals Saga, Hrafnkels Saga, and Laxdaela Saga, the first forms of prose fiction in the West- and will study the evolution of Icelandic law and feud customs, and the role of women in Nordic society. The final work from this period is the epic English poem Beowulf, where arguably literature in English begins. Reflecting the early history of England as an oft-invaded, often colonized nation, the poem, though in English, is set in Scandinavia and refracts English fears (and mythologization) of societal violence through the smoky lens of ancient Nordic history. The second culture we will focus on might be called \"romance culture,\" in part because it is largely confined to the romance languages, but also because \"literary romance,\" particularly Arthurian romance, is its characterizing genre. Romance culture of the 12th to the 14th centuries, like Nordic culture, was not confined within national boundaries. Hence, from France we will read Chr\xC3\xA9tien de Troyes Lancelot and Yvain, and from England, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. We will also study the evolution of chivalric ideology as a major cultural phenomenon arising from the collapse of older feudal relations. This new ideology brings in its train at least two major formations that affected the history of Europe for 500 years: romantic love (and with it a new conception of womanhood) and knighthood (and with it a new conception of manhood). To study the new romantic love, we will read Andreas Capellanus' Art of Courtly Love. On knighthood, we will read selections from Maurice Keen's Chivalry and from the works of Georges Duby and Jacques Le Goff on the medieval \"cultural imaginary.\" And from the end of the 14th century, we will read a classic anti-romance put ironically into the mouth of a woman: Chaucer's Wife of Bath's Tale. Finally, having seen that the term medieval has come to embrace these two widely disparate cultures, chronologically and ideologically utterly different, we will consider the origins and distortions of the terms \"medieval\" and \"Middle Ages\"- invented by a later age- and what might be called \"the politics of periodization.\" The course will be conducted as much as possible as a seminar, with students taking shared responsibility for discussions. There will be frequent short papers and two longer papers during the semester, with an emphasis on the writing and revising process."

But rather than simply repeat the achievements of the past they use their own individual voices to transform the practice of poetry for their era.

During class discussion we will look closely at traditional forms such as the sonnet, the ode, the elegy, and the poetic narrative and we will consider the ends they serve.

How do we understand these terms in relationship to each other and in the various cultural and historical contexts in which they are often used? Are there differences between the use of these terms in the visual and the literary arts? Through careful analysis of a number of films, literary works, and critical theory, this course will begin to answer these and other fundamental questions about modernism and postmodernism. We will pay particular attention to the ways in which certain writers and filmmakers self-consciously foreground the act of writing (or of making film) in their works. Texts for the course will include works by Joseph Conrad, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Katherine Anne Porter, John Fowles, Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Thomas Pynchon, and Margaret Atwood, as well as a number of critical essays. We will also look at the issues of modernism and postmodernism in such films as Man with a Movie Camera, Rear Window, The Matrix, and Adaptation.

    :number: "375"
    :description: The Decameron, one of the most entertaining, beloved and imitated prose works ever written, is an accurate reflection of fourteenth-century life in Italy. Like Dante's Divine Comedy, this human comedy was written not only to delight, but also to instruct by exploring both our spiritual and our natural environment. Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375), considered by some typically medieval and by others one of the first truly modern literary figures to emerge from the darkness of the Middle Ages into the light of the Renaissance, shows himself, as author of The Decameron, to be both a passionate believer and a passionate critic as he reconstructs society, destroyed by the Black Plague, through the perfection of his 100-fold narrative. Class discussions will focus on a close reading of the Decameron. Special class presentations will treat questions of Boccaccio's belief system as manifested in the Decameron, his sources and his imitators, and the sociocultural milieu in which he wrote. The Decameron will be read in its entirety in English translation. Conducted in English. This course satisfies one of the two literature and writing requirements of the College.

    :description: This course covers one of the most vital periods of music and dance in America. Ballet, modern dance, theatrical dance, dance in the movies, and social dance were all undergoing great changes as well as burgeoning popularity; and there was significant overlap between types that are today considered quite distinct. Ballet pioneer George Balanchine and modern dance choreographer Agnes de Mille not only innovated within "serious" theatrical dance but also made dances for Broadway and the movies; Fred Astaire brought social dance to a highly polished theatrical level with both his sister Adele and Ginger Rogers; football and hockey player Gene Kelly turned down a position with the Ballets Russes and went on to revolutionize dance on film; tap dance was, like rock and roll, an product of American racial interaction. This was also a period in which social dancing was a major shaping force of popular culture, from the swing of the 1930s through the jive of the 1940s and a string of Latin dance crazes, culminating in perhaps the greatest dance revolution of the century, the Twist. Other key figures include Martha Graham, Bill Robinson, Shirley Temple, Sonja Henie, the Nicholas Brothers, Eleanor Powell, and composers Aaron Copland, Richard Rodgers, and Elliott Carter.

In this course we will explore tension points of Soviet literature: masses and individuals, gender revised, search for new language, how to achieve immortality? Our focus is early Soviet culture as struggle of opposite social concepts and aesthetic systems. We will observe bizarre forms that traditional genres can take when they are filled with incompatible meanings. Every ideological concept in early Soviet times has its antagonist. What artistic prisms does it choose to represent its own truth? Can it appear in disguise of its rival? We will read plays (Gorky and Mayakovsky), poems (Akhmatova and Blok), novels (Gladkov and Platonov), and verify our interpretations on material of visual arts (paintings, films).

Are we ourselves Dostoevskian murderers who have forgotten about the murders we committed? The four great murder novels--Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Demons, (a.k.a., in English, The Possessed), and The Brothers Karamazov--seem to offer an answer. Memory and forgetting implicate the reader--specifically, the ongoing dialogue between people's memories and the lapses thereof. The author uses this dialogue to encode/"program" the reader's memory and to "infect" him/her with various faults of the characters' memory.

Scholars and critics have approached Gershwin's life and music with a wide range of interpretive perspectives and analytic tools. This course will be less a biographical study of this musical enigma than an attempt to place him within the broader context of American musical life. We will use Gershwin as a starting place to explore aspects of African-American music, Tin Pan Alley song, Broadway musicals, concert hall performance, opera, Hollywood film, the piano, media and technology, and the issue of \"Musical Jewishness.\" By focusing on Gershwin, we will see how a single American composer can bridge many of the dichotomies found in American music: black/white, highbrow/lowbrow, and art/pop.

    :description: "This course is designed to fulfill one semester of the Georgetown College Literature/Writing requirement. It is taught in English and all readings are in English; it assumes no knowledge of French. The course combines the pleasure of reading imaginative literature with the need to move beyond the pleasure principle and take a more distanced perspective. Its focus is thematic and interpretive. The readings are selected from French, German, and English literature (20th-12th centuries); there is also a film. These texts are all linked thematically in that they are stories about growing up and finding one's identity. Growing up is a complex, mysterious, and sometimes arduous process that the hero/heroine experiences as a magical world where the natural laws governing human existence are suspended, the unexpected is bound to occur, and marvels are reserved for the chosen few. The choices to be made, dangers to be faced, and discoveries to be made, all help the hero/heroine relate to his/her own world and the conventional, mundane public world outside. Friendship, family, love, good and evil, authority and power, success and failure, responsibility, belief and knowledge and inexplicable mystery--these are essential experiences that structure and develop identity, in real life and in literature, today as well as yesterday. These readings are fantastic in both senses of the word: they create for their hero/heroine a magical world that is outside us readers and yet inside us too, and they are fabulous reading.

How does the four-fold allegorical method of interpreting \"The Comedy\", recommended by Dante himself, help us to understand the reality of life in 14th-century Italy. Is the reading of \"The Comedy\" an exercise in literary curiosity or does it possess the power to affect modern readers in our own lived reality? In order to address these and similar concerns, we will read translated selections from other works by Dante and his contemporaries and consider reactions to \"The Comedy\" from such perceptive readers as Boccaccio and T.S.

    :description: Catholicism has a history in Japan longer than the United States has been around. Beginning with the arrival of St. Francis Xavier in 1549, Catholicism has shaped Japanese culture in subtle but profound ways. How many people realize that tempura has its origins in the dietary requirements of Jesuits during Lent (the tempora when meat was not to be eaten)? This course seeks to enrich our understanding of Japanese culture by challenging stereotypes of Japanese culture as either "non-religious" (materialistic) or "not-our-religious" (Buddhist, Confucian, etc). Simultaneously, it challenges Eurocentric views that reduce Catholicism to an expression of Western culture. Readings include historical texts, theological works, and novels (especially the novels by the Catholic writer, Endo Shusaku). Take a course at Georgetown that will introduce you to what St. Francis Xavier struggled with at the end of his life! Course and readings are in English.

The central text will be Dante's Divine Comedy, but our approach will be interdisciplinary and we will also read works by Augustine, Boethius, Virgil, Italian poets (Guinizelli, Cavalcante) and historians (Dino Compagni) contemporary with Dante. We will study the Lorenzetti frescoes painted in the Palazzo Publico in Siena and some works of Giotto.

    :number: "463"
    :description: This course (taught in English) explores the Four Great Murder Novels, and, time permitting, -The Adolescent-. How can all the "-isms" Dostoevsky's characters and narrators so passionately proclaim agree with what the writer himself regarded as a system of absolute values? All the explanations provided by all the "-isms" and everyone's passionately personal "-ism" are true but insufficient. What is sufficient is unpronouceable. This course teaches us how Dostoevesky encodes unshakeable values in conspicuous omissions. He develops a powerful narrative and structural technique which treats precisely what matters most as unmentionable. This allows him to be tolerant toward a multitutde of voices without losing his own, as well as to move the forbidden from the realm of external law to that of the inner voice of one's conscience. There is a mid-term examination and a final paper. (Conducted in English; no knowledge of the Russian language required.)

Learning to think, create, and organize visually has been an essential part of a college education. A visual education reflects Georgetown's mission to educate the whole person. In today's world, it is necessary to understand and communicate information visually. We will explore ideas and concepts in the visual arts through a sequence of projects in the studio emphasizing \"visual syntax.\" Projects will be conceived and developed in two and three dimensional mediums: paint on paper, photography, collage, and constructions. There will be slide talks, visits to artist's studios (to my studio & home) and to galleries and museums throughout the city. You will practice organizing your ideas, interests, or concerns in a coherent visual context. Projects conclude with discussions and critiques where everyone can contribute their insights and opinions. No prior experience in the studio is necessary; it all starts here."

The theme for Fall 2007 is \"Biology and Society.\" No science in the second half of the twentieth century has transformed human life more than biology. The discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 began the \"genomic age\" in which we now live. The seminar will consider major issues of that age that have become topics of public debate, including stem cells, cloning, genetically modified organisms, infectious agents, the neurobiology of cognition and memory, as well as larger issues that touch deep-seated beliefs, such as the origin of life. As these and other biological concepts are covered, students will also become acquainted with the contemporary social and philosophical issues that surround them, including the special nature of biological knowledge and how our conception both of ourselves and of the human species have been transformed by modern biology. The seminar will address such issues as: whether morality is a product of evolution, whether the complexity of life precludes the role of chance, and whether free will is compatible with current theories in biology. The purpose of the seminar is thus to enhance scientific literacy by learning how to speak about contemporary biological issues both scientifically and philosophically. The seminar will incorporate learning techniques that stress classroom discussion and active engagement in an interdisciplinary approach to science studies. The seminar also fosters close interaction with its two faculty members, Dr. James Mattingly in Philosophy and Dr. Maria Donoghue in Biology, through off-campus activities, including Washingtonarea field trips and \"discussion dinners\" at local restaurants.

    :description: "This seminar serves as an introduction to the Program in Social and Political Thought. The central purpose of the seminar is to examine and evaluate modern scholars\xE2\x80\x99 efforts to study human beings scientifically. Achieving this purpose will require (1) that we gain a clear understanding of what scientific inquiry is, (2) that we consider what must be true about human beings, as both agents and inquirers, if we are to conclude that the scientific method is the most appropriate way to study human affairs, and (3) that we ask how the scientific study of human affairs furthers and/or hinders our efforts to make sense of our experience as human beings. The course is organized chronologically. Because the leaders of the seventeenth century scientific revolution rebelled self-consciously against the Aristotelian mode of thinking, we will begin by trying to understand how Aristotle thought. After considering several key philosophical issues that lay beneath the scientific revolution, the remainder of the semester will be devoted to examining the writings of four influential social scientists: Adam Smith, William James, Max Weber, and Franz Boas. Critical analysis of these authors\xE2\x80\x99 work will help us grasp the defining preoccupations of the various social scientific disciplines, assess whether practicing social scientists in fact accomplish that to which they aspire, and consider what has been gained and lost in moving the study of human affairs beyond Aristotle."

    :description: What do student organizations, church groups, trade unions and private newspapers have in common? They are all examples of civil society and they have at times played a critical role in challenging repressive and authoritarian governments across sub-Saharan Africa. Yet in modern Africa critics also charge that civil society weakens the already fragile state, and is often undemocratic in its own internal and inter-organizational dynamics. In this course we will consider the intellectual roots of the idea of civil society, as well as assess what African experiences with civil society can teach us about the possibility of democracy to transform lives in other parts of the world. Through case studies of particular countries, including Ghana, South Africa, Ethiopia, we will consider the specific instances of civil society involvement in the context of particular African countries. We will look at the way people use community associations and other networks to avoid involvement in politics, to resist interventions from the state (political, economic and social), and sometimes to directly confront politicians and political leadership. Finally, we will consider whether women, ethnic groups, religious associations or other categories of civil society are more or less likely to contribute to democracy in Africa. The lessons learned apply not only to Africa, but to other newly democratizing countries.

In high immigration receiving states such as Australia and the United States-among the world's most inclusive migrant incorporation regimes-immigration increasingly complicates foreign policymaking choices, and may present challenges to each host nation's internal cohesion. Issues such as dual nationality, social exclusion, multiculturalism, and fear of international terrorism-especially ina post-9/11 context-generate considerable political heat and public debate. This course will examine the migration-security nexus and the policy choices that Australia and the United States confront. Some of the fundamental questions that will be addressed include: What causes people to migrate across national borders and settle in foreign countries? How do Australia and the United States weigh the benefits and costs of migration? How do migrants in Australia and the United States maintain social and political relationships with those back in their home countries, and does this affect their sense of national allegiance and social integration into their host societies? To what extent do migrants and their descendants alter foreign policy considerations or affect international relations? And how do Australians and Americans cope with conflicts between ethnic or migrant communities when those conflicts originate, or are strongly fueled by, homeland conflicts?"

While these societies vary in their organizing principles, their fundamental beliefs about sources of authority, and in conceptions about the nature of their societies, their similarities make it possible to isolate\xE2\x80\x94and understand\xE2\x80\x94the factors responsible for the differences among them.

The reading list is designed to provide a diversity of opinion and perspectives on a wide range of subjects in international relations. Each student will read, and write short notes upon, at least ten of the thirteen readings. The readings include eight novels, two anthologies of poems and short stories, one play, one classic of traveler\xE2\x80\x99s literature, and one graphic novel. The course has three objectives. First, the texts will expose students to important works in both Asian and Western letters. The reading list includes classics from the ancient and medieval worlds, notable authors of the 20th century, and emerging voices of the 21st century. Some of these are texts that any well-rounded person should know, especially one who aspires to an international career. Second, class discussions will encourage critical thinking about factual and normative concepts of foreign policy in general, and relations between Asian and Western countries in particular. Among the issues to be explored are the proper means and ends of foreign policy, the human impact of policy decisions, the cultural roots of conflict, and the relationship between the state and the artist (censorship and propaganda). Third, the assignments will help students improve their abilities to write effective prose.

    :description: Dramatic developments over the past few years have given a new and compelling importance to U.S. relations with much of South Asia. The Indian and Pakistan nuclear bomb test, the dangerous India-Pakistan confrontation over Kashmir, growing instability in Pakistan, the increasingly close ties between Washington and New Delhi, the new role of South Asian communities in this country as a factor in U.S. policymaking, and, most important, the rise in Afghanistan of the Taliban and its fostering of international terrorism have all contributed to the region's enhanced priority for the United States. This course will look at American relations with these three South Asian countries and trace how they got there. Its focus will be on developments in the past decade, since the end of the Cold War provided a backdrop for the major changes in the way U.S. policymakers have dealt with the region. It will also review key factors and events since the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947 that shaped U.S. policy in the area and the polices and attitudes the South Asian countries have adopted toward the United States.

    :description: Most sub-Saharan African governments began independence as democracies. With few exceptions, they gave way to authoritarian rule and remained so for 25 years. At the beginning of the 1990s, a wave of political liberalization began to sweep across the region. This course will examine the nature of political institutions and political rule in sub-Saharan Africa since independence, including the factors leading to these political changes. Key topics will include the colonial political inheritance, ethnicity and social characteristics of African societies, the nature of and role of the military, political parties, legislatures, judiciaries, the media, interest groups, patronage networks, external powers, and the role of economic conditions (including structural adjustment programs) in influencing African politics. The course will conclude by asking whether the current trend toward democratization will endure. Fall and Spring.

    :description: Using materials culled from the writings of social theorists, philosophers, novelists, psychologists, historians and political figures, among others, this course examines modern anti-Semitism and its equally intriguing, though somewhat lesser known counterpart, philo-Semitism. Starting with a brief overview of the ancient taproots of anti-Semitism, the class scrutinizes modern thinkers who evince an obsession with Jews and those who seek to explain the causes and effects of this particular fixation. In addition to classic anti-Semitic tracts (e.g., The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, Mein Kampf and the work of various renowned "high-culture" anti-Semites) writers to be read include Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Jean-Paul Sartre, Hannah Arendt, Philip Roth, Pierre Birnbaum, and Arthur Hertzberg. The course ends with a survey of contemporary concerns such as the relation between anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism, and the philo-Semitism to be found among modern-day Christian fundamentalists.

    :description: This seminar will look at diplomacy as a political process and as an instrument of foreign policy. It will examine the role and responsibilities of the ambassador and other members of an overseas mission, explore the resources and techniques available to them, and review the way diplomats relate to the government they serve and the one to which they are accredited. It will also look critically at the backup at the headquarters end of diplomacy (e.g. Washington), examining the functioning of the foreign policy bureaucracy and its interaction with overseas operations. It will survey the historical evolution of diplomacy and the impact of recent political, economic, social, and technological changes on diplomatic practices. It will also consider the relationship between diplomacy and intelligence operations and the growth in importance of "new" areas of foreign policy concern such as counter-terrorism and the prevention of drug trafficking and cross-border crime. The course will focus primarily on U.S. diplomatic practices, but much of the material is also relevant to the way other governments organize their diplomatic activities. In a final session, three foreign diplomats representing countries of differing size and circumstance will discuss the way their countries practice diplomacy and compare this with the U.S. approach. The instructor is a retired U.S. ambassador. Several other American career diplomats will also meet with the class.

Through a series of case studies, individual countries will be examined in light of their own unique political histories, but also with regard to international norms of democracy and human rights an the impact of globalization. In addition, three cross-cutting issues in Southeast Asia will be considered: the political consequences of the 1997-98 economic crisis; the rise and role of political Islam; and the growing demand for accountability, for both human rights abuse and political corruption. Students will pursue individual projects to assess the prospects for political change in a Southeast Asian country of their choice."

  - :name: "Vietnam: Both Sides Now"
    :number: "374"
    :description: Thirty years after the end of the war and ten years after normalization of relations, Vietnam, continues to haunt and even confound US policymakers and the American public. The war in Iraq has revived debate about the conduct of the Vietnam war, as well as US nation-building policy in South Vietnam. Regardless of their positions on the war, American diplomats, military officers and historians are in broad agreement that the United States did not sufficiently understand the Vietnamese, from the North or the South. Courses on the Vietnam War and on US relations with Vietnam since then tend to continue this one-sided approach, by relying predominantly (or exclusively)on American sources. This course will examine the past and current U.S. relationship with Vietnam from multiple angles. The war will be considered from the perspective of the United States, North Vietnam, South Vietnam, and the National Liberation Front. The current relationship will be assessed from the viewpoint of both countries and of the Vietnamese diaspora. Pivotal events - e.g., the Geneva Accords of 1954; the 1973 Peace Agreement; the fall of Saigon in 1975; the Vietnamese invasion of Camobodia in 1978; and the two major attempts to normalize relations (unsuccessful in the late 1970's and successful in the mid-1990's) will be studied from both sides, using the English-language Vietnamese sources as well as American ones. The course will also consider the full complement of issues in the current U.S.-Vietnam relationship, ranging from security cooperation to human rights, from the perspective of each nation.

In an era of growing globalization, with the United States facing such transnational threats as terrorism, ethnic violence and the proliferation of mass destruction technologies, the distinction between domestic and international crises is increasingly blurred. This situation raises significant questions about the appropriate use of Armed Forces and Defense resources in responding to these new threats to U.S. security.

    :description: "This anthropology course is designed to introduce students to the processes and forms of cultural retention, acculturation, syncretism, reinterpretation, transformation, and innovation that are evident in African derived cultural diaspoas of the Americas. While the ownership of black cultural forms in the \xE2\x80\x98New World\xE2\x80\x99 has has been a perennial and complex issue during the 20th century, things become clearer as we unravel the strands of culture, power, and history. Using anthropological concepts, we explore the processes that brought African social and cultural institutions as well as Islam to the Diasporas of the Caribbean, Latin America, and the United States. We build upon Wallerstein and Rodney\xE2\x80\x99s notions of a world economic system to show how the use of slave labor fueled the development of the Americas, and look at the cultural byproduct of that labor. Examining African social and cultural adaptations to the plantation economies, to gender and spiritual challenges, and to urban life helps us trace the cultural forms and commodities produced, and the commonalities and variations that emerged within black populations of these areas. We examine the cultural forms of resistance to domination and the creation of different creole cultures in the Americas, as Africans dealt with Indigenous peoples, Anglos, Spanish, French, and Portuguese. Some of the cultural areas we examine include Brazil, Haiti, Jamaica, Ecuador/Colombia, Cuba, New Orleans, South Carolina, and other historical and recent black cultures of the United States."

Although the \xE2\x80\x9Csecularization theory\xE2\x80\x9D holds that faith will diminish with the advance of modernity, religious actors and communities have become major players in the 21st century. It is perhaps fortuitous that the United States is the only country in the world with an official policy of advancing international religious freedom (IRF). This course will examine the politics of U.S. IRF policy, its origins and performance to date, and its prospects for development. Along the way it will explore the attitudes about religion and religious freedom which have helped to mold the policy. It will ask whether U.S. strategies have reduced religious persecution, or advanced religious freedom, and what impact they have had on terrorism and the American freedom agenda in the greater Middle East. It will examine the extent to which IRF policy has helped U.S. diplomacy engage a world increasingly influenced by faith."

What is the explanation for the seemingly irresistible power of Americanization? When did this process begin and what has America's role been in this process? Or, conversely, is Americanization an illusion? Has there been appropriation and resistance so that national identities and diversity have been sustained and even intensified? Has it provoked a search for identity in national or ethnic difference? Above all what does this transformation mean?"

    :number: "535"
    :description: Spain and Latin (mostly Spanish) America share a long history. But their development since American independence has been strikingly similar for a long time. It is no more the case. The current disparity makes differences and turning points highly interesting and revealing. This course will explore both similarities and differences in economic, political and social aspects, within a historical framework. We will start with the colonial heritage and conclude with current trends and issues. A lot of attention will be paid to Spain and Latin America relationship and reaction to world developments.

    :number: "546"
    :description: "Terrorism has gone from a persistent yet marginal security concern to one of the most important problems of our day. As the September 11, 2001 attacks made clear, terrorists can and will kill thousands to pursue their ends. In addition to threatening the United States, terrorists menace governments worldwide: indeed, there are few if any countries that do not suffer from some form of terrorism. This course examines a wide range of questions in order to provide students with a deeper understanding of the threat of terrorism today. Among the questions it examines are: What is terrorism? How has the threat of terrorism changed over time? What motivates different types of terrorist groups? When does terrorism succeed and fail? How can terrorism best be fought? This course explores the nature of terrorism, the motivations of terrorists, and the tactics that terrorists use. It surveys state-sponsored terrorist groups, as well as several leading past and current radical groups. The final weeks of the course will assess different methods of countering terrorism, ranging from law enforcement to covert action."

    :number: "550"
    :description: "This course examines the birth, growth, and institutionalization of secularism in Turkey, a rare democracy among Muslim majority countries. The course analyzes the historical and political factors that have driven secularism in Turkey, including the military, Turkish/Balkan Islam, Ataturk\xE2\x80\x99s legacy, laicite, and now the European Union (EU) process. The course also studies the connection between secularism and the country\xE2\x80\x99s pro-Western foreign policy orientation. In doing this, the course provides a narrative of Ottoman and Turkish history since the eighteenth century, analyzing the Turks\xE2\x80\x99 evolving relationship with the West (especially Europe) and the gradual secularization of Turkish society. The course also studies the Islamist challenge to Turkish secularism in order to analyze the future of secularism and the durability of the Turks\xE2\x80\x99 identification with the West in the post September 11 world."

    :number: "554"
    :description: "Starting with the paradoxical features of \xE2\x80\x9Cnew regionalism\xE2\x80\x9D in a globalizing economy, the course is designed as an introduction into the politics of regional market integration. Aspects to be covered are the theory and history of regional integration, the position regional integration takes within the global trading system (i.e. the GATT/WTO framework) as well as a in depth discussion of the arguments of the so called \xE2\x80\x9Cstumbling block/stepping stone\xE2\x80\x9D-controversy. We will investigate into regional spaces as structural features of a global political economy and regional integration as both a public and private actor-driven process. There will be a special focus on the issue of change: what is \xE2\x80\x9Cnew\xE2\x80\x9D about \xE2\x80\x9Cnew regionalism\xE2\x80\x9D compared to the \xE2\x80\x9Cold\xE2\x80\x9D and how can we understand \xE2\x80\x9Cnew regionalism\xE2\x80\x9D within the overall context of a changing international system? A strong theoretical and conceptual approach in the first part will be complemented by case studies in the second (EU, MERCOSUR, NAFTA, ASEAN or APEC together with examples of the new phenomenon of inter-regionalism such as the Asia-Europe Meeting or the EU-MERCOSUR Interregional Framework Agreement; decision on specific case studies depending on students interests)."

  - :name: Civil Military Relations
    :number: "612"
    :description: "The study of civil-military relations addresses a simple puzzle: can we have a military strong enough to protect civilians yet not so strong as to ignore or subvert civilian direction? After all, a military that is strong enough to defend the state from its external enemies is also strong enough to seize power so as to rule for itself. How do you have a strong military capability without being swallowed by it? In this course, we will examine the variety of ways that the civil-military relationship can vary -- how political leaders, society and military organizations interact, and how their cultures overlap and diverge. We will explore how this relationship can matter for important political outcomes, such as regime change, democratization, military policy, decision-making in crises and wars, military innovation and defense transformation, and military effectiveness. Students will master the basic theories of civil-military relations, study past and current controversies, and develop awareness of issues that remain unsettled, such as the use of military forces to handle domestic crises like Hurricane Katrina. The course will focus primarily on the US case, but the theoretical frameworks covered have broad application to other advanced democracies and developing countries. Students will be required to attend a battlefield staff ride of Antietam on one Saturday during the semester."

In 1998 Congress unanimously passed the International Religious Freedom Act (IRFA) and President Clinton immediately signed it into law. IRFA requires the United States to advance religious freedom worldwide and provides a host of mechanisms to advance that goal. After almost a decade of operation, however, the results are decidedly mixed: religious persecution remains a pressing international problem.. This course will address the evolution and impact of U.S. policy by examining its political sources, bureaucratic implementation, practical effectiveness, and future prospects. Topics will include the perception of US policy abroad and debates within international institutions about the meaning of religious freedom and its political and policy implications."

This seminar will survey Bush administration foreign and defense policies. How did top policy makers think about America\xE2\x80\x99s chief interests in the world, try to advance those interests and respond to danger? Officials asked: What do U.S. national security officials aim to secure? What kind of world does the United States want to inhabit \xE2\x80\x93 and what power do we have to help shape it? Students will learn how President Bush and his team answered \xE2\x80\x93 and how the United States built strategies on the answers. Topics will include: the concept of world order, the rising and falling of major powers, alliances and partnerships, weapons proliferation, ungoverned and ill-governed territories \xE2\x80\x93 as well as the war on terrorism and the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq. The seminar will discuss Bush administration policies on democracy promotion, stabilization and reconstruction operations, the U.S. global defense posture, the Arab-Israeli conflict and new relationships with China, Russia, India, NATO and the states of Central Asia.

Close attention will be paid to the definition of \"refugee\" in international conventions and under U.S. law, with emphasis on such topics as: What constitutes persecution? What forms of persecution support an asylum claim? What conduct renders an applicant ineligible for asylum? How are persons fleeing violence (rather than persecution) treated? We will also analyze overseas refugee processing, procedures for adjudicating asylum claims, rights of asylum seekers, detention and the granting of temporary protection to those fleeing civil wars. Special attention will also be given to issues involving asylum claims based on gender. Finally, we will examine the rights of internally displaced persons."

The countries covered include Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. These countries are among the poorest in the world, and, therefore, the course necessarily focuses on poverty-related issues, including the relationship between poverty, inequality and economic growth. The first part of the course covers the nature and causes of South Asia\xE2\x80\x99s development performance. In this context, the major determinants of growth are analyzed, including: sector policies; macroeconomic management; human capital development; governance, including, in particular, public sector management; saving and investment behavior; financial intermediation, including microfinance; technological innovation; and exogenous factors such as natural resources and geography. Both theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence are exam ined. The second part of the course is devoted to other special and related contemporary development issues in South Asia, including: the sustainability of India\xE2\x80\x99s current growth rate; the comparative economic development performance of civilian and military regimes in Pakistan; human security (this year\xE2\x80\x99s lead theme for the Human Development in South Asia report); the impact of official development aid (ODA); the lessons from East Asia; regional cooperation and South Asia\xE2\x80\x99s future prospects. Throughout the course, basic theoretical concepts and analytical tools are presented and applied to help facilitate a better understanding of the development performance of the countries in the region."

    :description: "It is commonly assumed that democracy makes two small presuppositions about citizens: First, that they are capable of taking responsibility for their actions; and second, that they are capable of being responsive enough to reasons to participate meaningfully in public debate. Nowadays, many people both inside and outside the university consider those two presuppositions to be demonstrably false. People, it is said, are certainly not responsive to rationality but to something else: Desires, ideologies, power, interests, and so forth; and people, it is said, are not necessarily capable of assuming responsibility for themselves since such responsibility presupposes social conditions that aren\xE2\x80\x99t usually present in the modern world. If that is true, what is the basis and/or underlying rationale of democratic politics? To get an idea as to how in general we might go about trying to answer this question, we shall look first at one of the great classical treatises on politics: Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s Politics. We shall then jump to an examination of modern liberal, individualist theories of government; we will put particular emphasis on two competing traditions in modernity: Social contract traditions, which try to understand political life as being legitimated by some kind of real or imagined \xE2\x80\x9Ccontract\xE2\x80\x9D or fairly explicit set of agreements among citizens and each other and between citizens and the government; and non-contractarian traditions, which try to understand the legitimating basis of political life in appeals to \xE2\x80\x9Cforms of life,\xE2\x80\x9D or common modes of participation in social and political life. Our goal will be to become more clear to ourselves about just what is at stake in such theories and what is their significance for our current conceptions of the future of democracy. Among the social-contractarians to be studied are Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, and Rawls; among the non-contractarians will be Aristotle, Hume, Marx, Mill, and Habermas.

Inspired by Benedict Anderson\xE2\x80\x99s (1983) equation of nineteenth century nationalist ideologies with \xE2\x80\x98imagined communities\xE2\x80\x99, and Arjun Appadurai\xE2\x80\x99s (1990) account of \xE2\x80\x98imagined worlds\xE2\x80\x99 in the present-day global cultural economy, this course will examine how over recent decades New Zealand has redefined itself as \xE2\x80\x98a Pacific nation\xE2\x80\x99, and why in turn Pacific Islands nations generally have cautiously accepted New Zealand\xE2\x80\x99s regionalist identity assertions and associated leadership assumptions.

The list of such global issues, defined as those that affect large number of persons in the world across many nations and require global action beyond what nation states can do at their level, is growing while the global agreements/mechanisms are falling short of what needs to be done to shape a better world for all. Already the list of global issues that are making headlines and getting public attention includes: global poverty; conflicts; communicable diseases; migration; climate change; access to water, malnutrition; etc. Effects of these global issues are already being felt in our societies, economy, health, security and environment. These are expected to become even more acute as in the next 50 years, the global population will increase from 6 to 9 billion people and the global economy may be four times its current size. The mechanisms for addressing global issues are still evolving and will be challenged even more as time passes and world's population and economy expand. In this context, the World Bank has developed a Global Issues Seminar Series that is currently being offered, via videoconferencing distance learning mode, to students in Europe, Africa, Middle East and USA and has tailored it to the curriculum at Georgetown University.

    :description: Illicit drugs have profound detrimental effects in developing countries, where most narcotics are produced. While the narcotics business has a mixed impact on the economy, it is the underlying cause of weak governance, violent conflict, the spread of AIDS and environmental degradation. National and international efforts at control and strategies and programs for supply and demand reduction have had only limited success and illegal drugs remain a scourge for the developing world. This class will begin with a brief analysis of the role of intoxicants in global history. We will then pay special attention to the role of psychoactive substances as a commodity in the making of the global economy. We will critically study the changing attitudes to narcotics and efforts at drug control which have fueled the illegal drug industry in the 20th century. In our analysis of development oriented drug control we will focus on the success and failures of strategies and programs to reduce the supply and demand of illegal drugs in the Third World. Specifically, we will assess the impact of production, trafficking and use of narcotics in case studies of the Andean Region, Afghanistan and Thailand. Finally, we will look at the policies and strategies of the United States Government with regard to illegal drugs in the Third World.

In the context of the Iraq issue, such factors as the following will be examined: \xE2\x80\xA2 the end of the Cold War and the emergence of the U.S. as the sole superpower; \xE2\x80\xA2 the impact of globalization and its challenge to the Westphalian system; \xE2\x80\xA2 socio-cultural developments (secularism, multilateralism, demilitarization, pacifism), economic issues (social welfare, economic stagnation) and demographic trends (birth dearth, aging population, Muslim immigration) affecting Europe and relationships between the U.S. and its European allies; \xE2\x80\xA2 rapid population growth, economic and political stagnation, and rapidly-expanding information technology and access in the Arab world, and the impact of these factors on the Arab street; \xE2\x80\xA2 religious, ethnic, economic and cultural factors within Iraq which are affecting developments there. The course will draw significantly on the instructor\xE2\x80\x99s experience serving as Minister-Counselor for Public Affairs at the U.S. Embassies in Baghdad (2004-2005), Berlin (2000-2004), and Riyadh (1997-2000)."

The currents of change, triggered by the end of the Cold War, globalization, the region\xE2\x80\x99s nuclearization, resurgence of China and the emerging shift in the balance of power in Asia, the rise of religious extremism and war on terrorism, have been flowing in different directions.

The oldest treaty ally of the United States in Asia, it was a strong Cold War U.S. ally and, after the fall of Saigon, a frontline state against communist Indochina. In the 1980\xE2\x80\x99s, Thailand became one of Asia\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Ceconomic miracles.\xE2\x80\x9D In 1997, however, a sharp drop in the Thai baht launched the Asian economic crisis. Since September 11, 2001, tensions in the Thai Muslim community in the southern provinces have risen to crisis level and, more recently, Thai islands in the Adaman Sea were devastated by the tsunami. Although Thailand retains close ties with the United States, it has also developed one of the region\xE2\x80\x99s closest partnerships with China. Thailand is also unique in many ways. It is one of the few developing countries that was never colonized and, in the late twentieth century, was one of the few Asian societies which democratized during the \xE2\x80\x9CThird Wave\xE2\x80\x9D of global democracy. This course will explore Thailand\xE2\x80\x99s history, politics, economics and security in the context of Southeast Asia\xE2\x80\x99s development as a region. By focusing on Thailand as exemplary of Southeast Asia\xE2\x80\x99s problems and progress, students will be able to understand the region as a whole.

  - :name: Political Violence in Africa
    :number: "369"
    :description: This course will allow the students to deconstruct the specific causes, meanings, and consequences of political violence in 20th century Africa. We will explore recent and current categories of political violence including state violence against ethnic and regional minorities (Darfur, Southern Sudan, Ethiopia); the use of paramilitary militias by states to defeat oppposition groups (Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Kenya); and movements by militias and private armies to carve out control of resource-rich areas (the DRC, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria). This course will also explore the changing nature of political violence over the past 50 years, emphasizing the continuities and changes from the period of anti-colonial wars (Algeria, Kenya's 'Mau Mau' war, and the Liberation wars against the Portuguese); examples of Cold War related political violence and wars (Mozambique, Angola, Ethiopia/Eritrea, and Somalia), and urban anti-apartheid political violence in South Africa. The changing nature of violence itself will be a main theme, examining the role of child soldiers, political motivations behind ethnic 'cleansing' and genocide, and the influence of external military aid, private soldiers, and the international arms trade. We will also investigate how African peace movements and the international community have responded to political violence. The role and limits of non-violence, humanitarian aid, and peace keeping to confront these new realities will also be examined. A fundamental goal of the course is to gain a better understanding of how political violence has transformed notions of sovereignty, citizenship, human rights, and the rule of law in specific African contexts.

    :number: "382"
    :description: As China continues to grow rapidly and trade and investment relationships between the United States and China continue to expand, trade policy implications between the two countries arise prominent issues. Pressures to use trade policy to address issues such as trade deficit, intellectual property rights, labor and environmental standards, foreign investment, and competition policy are increasing. As international trade policies move beyond barriers such as quotas and tariffs, towards issues that impinge more deeply on domestic policy and sovereignty, it is becoming more critical to have a greater understanding of both countries' domestic economic and trade policies, plus a higher level of international rules. The US-China Trade Policy Seminar is designed to provide that training. Rather than presenting a single point of view, the seminar offeres a full range of ideas on trade polciy, helping students learn how to understand various factors driving the deep divisions between China and the United States. The course is divided into four parts. The first part will be devoted to giving students a solid grounding in economic theories of trade policy in general. The second part will assess the political and economic structures and their impacts on trade policies in the United States and China respectively, and to encourage specific understanding about how U.S. and China trade policies are actually made. The third part will provide more knowledge about the World Trade Organization(WTO) and other key international institutions that make and enforce trade rules, and how the US and China will cooperate under this world trading system. In the last part, it will focus on the several current important trade issues between US and China, such as currency convertibility and trade deficit, non-market economic treatment and trade remedy, outsourcing and unemployment, etc. Students taking the course should have some prior exposure to micro- and macroeconomics.

    :description: This seminar course takes an anthropological approach to the consideration of cultural issues being confronted within Africa today, and seeks to explore the intersections of indigenous cultural agency and national or internationally driven foreign policies. We first gain an understanding of how anthropologists have viewed continuity and change within African cultures, and then examine the dialogues between local, regional, and national levels of culture within different African societies. We use African case studies from development anthropology, political anthropology, and gender and development to see what type of policy issues arise over time. Drwaing on contemporary engaged anthropological approaches, we examine the strategies that different groups within particular African countries have attempted to address national problems such as economic restructuring, civil war or de-militarization, and inter-religious conflicts, emphasizing how they see the policy interface on these issues. We seek an answer to the question of whether the foreign policy arena has been concerned with the African cultural issues involved in health crises, conflict resolution, and international trade until the recent period, and how varying national interests have affected the culture/policy interface. Using digital video teleconferencing, our class will have regular conversations with U.S. Africa policymakers on these issues.

These revolutions in information and technology are also increasing trade integration and other interdependences across countries and regions. The course starts with a brief overview of the role of technology in growth and development, as well as the basics of invention, innovation, and commercialization of technology. It explores the interplay between four critical elements of a country's readiness to take advantage of these revolutions: a demanding economic incentive and institutional regime; an educated and skilled population; a dynamic information infrastructure; and an effective innovation system. It uses measures of these elements to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the US, the main European countries, Japan, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, and major developing regions. It also explores how the technology and information revolutions affect four key issues of global concern: inequality, security, sustainability, and quality of life. With these building blocks and some basic assumptions about key political and economic trends, students will be asked to project how the world may look in 2020, and to propose actions to improve these prospective futures.

  - :name: Nationalism in the 21st Century
    :number: "530"
    :description: Nationalism is, together with religion, the only phenomenon capable of mobilizing people in our current days. It is surprising since modern nationalism dates back to the 19th century. Social scientists have created many explanations of nationalism. This course attempts at reviewing the major theoretical perspectives accounting for the success of nationalism in conflictive areas. It will focus on the analysis of the nation, its constitutive elements, its relationship with the state, its conflictive and contemporary logic with democracy, and the collective identities of the members of the nation. The course will be a survey of the major schools of thought dealing with the problem of nationalism in the social sciences. Extensive examples from Spain and Europe will be used to illustrate these theories. The instructor will use survey data from the Centre of Sociological Research (CIS) and the Eurobarometer to articulate different explanations of nationalism and their utility to explain the case of Spain in the European framework. The course is thought to be a specialized seminar addressed at those students willing to gain substantive knowledge on a topic that puzzles many social scientists and politicians. The course is addressed to students taking courses in History, Sociology, Political Science, and Humanities.

    :number: "534"
    :description: "Organizations have become major players in our social life. A century ago, individuals barely had contact with two or three organizations in their lifetime. Nowadays, our lives develop inside organizations (hospitals, schools, universities, companies, trade unions, parties). The social sciences have developed several approaches accounting for this phenomenon and providing insights about how organizations work, relate to each other, and what is the role of individuals and their relationships inside organizations. This is an introductory course on organizations. It aims at understanding and explaining the \xE2\x80\x9Corganizational society\xE2\x80\x9D reviewing the major theories put forward by sociologists, economists, and historians. The course is addressed at students majoring in economics, sociology, political science, business, or history. Each week the student will do readings and discuss them with his/her fellow students. During the course the student should become familiar with the major ideas, authors, and works in the field. There could be some extra activities like visiting companies or watching movies related to particular topics of the syllabus."

Special attention will be devoted to the expulsion of the Ottoman Muslims into Turkey, and their gradual amalgamation into the Turkish nation. Students will develop a framework within which to evaluate Turkish nationalism as well as some of the most significant recent and current conflicts in former Ottoman lands: conflict in the Middle East; the Armenian catastrophe; Kurdish nationalism; the Balkan Wars; as well as recent conflicts in Kosovo, Bosnia and Chechnya."

  - :name: "Project Finance: The Persian Gulf"
    :number: "551"
    :description: This course would be based on a series of simulations. It would seek to teach the students how projects are actually negotiated in the Gulf, but also worldwide. The course will discuss the various financing techniques involved. However, it will also greatly emphasize how the governments, local investors, foreign investors, technology partners and banks have to interact in order to achieve the establishment of a new project. In fact real project finance is eminently political. It brings out competition between various governments to place their own technologies in the Gulf. It shows how savvy investors can play governments, banks and companies to get the best deal. The simulations will be run along basic scenarios, such as the establishment of a highly profitable, but obscure petrochemical in the Gulf using US technology, local investors, Chinese buyers, and bureaucratic government officials. The class would divided between the various actor and would negotiate the deal around a feasibility study which they would have to write. In my experience, these simulations are extremely well received by the students. I have run them in the US and in Europe with good success. Students discover that they do not have to be finance experts to actually negotiate project finance deals. Thus the simulations benefit political scientists, business majors, journalists and engineers alike.

  - :name: UN Peace Operations- US and European Intervention
    :number: "552"
    :description: This course will offer a sociological perspective on UN contemporary peace operations, focusing the analysis on the multiple connections between their local and global dimensions, and providing students with concrete analytic skills applicable in their future professional life. It will study the main evolutions in the conception and practices of peace operations, focusing on the main challenges for both decision-makers and practitioners participating in field missions. Three main patterns of evolutions will be examined. First, the international context in which interventions are decided has drastically changed in the recent years; new modes and frames of action have been developed. Second, in the field, peacekeepers no longer intervene on battlefields or along front lines, but at the very heart of the local societies; they consequently need to understand and take into account contexts which are, by definition, very complex and volatile, as well as the logic and vision peculiar to different groups of actors. This raises new practical and ethical issues for field workers. Third, the evolving conception of the function and role of peace builders much further implicates outsiders in restructuring domestic political and social orders. As such, it raises additional issues and requires new skills. All of this calls not only for a reform but a true mental revolution in the way we are thinking of war and peace. In that perspective, the course will combine ground-level empirical analysis and theoretical as well as ethical reflection. It will also offer a comparative view of the evolutions in US and European doctrines and modes of intervention, showing their connections with the societal perceptions of war and peace. Finally, it will examine a wide range of case studies, in a constant cross-cutting and comparative analysis, allowing the students to deepen their understanding of the cases over the weeks and to understand them comparatively. Concrete tools for comparative analysis and for lessons learnt will be proposed to students, an exercise for which both practitioners and diplomats are generally under-equipped.

This seminar focuses on understanding what distinguishes today's European order from previous orders, how Europe has reached its current position, and what is relevant about the past for understanding Europe's future. The course explores the role of the balance of power in the European state system, the origins and consolidation of the Cold War stalemate, the nature of alliances, the attempts to enhance security through detente, and the debate over why the system collapsed. It also examines the central role of Germany, the content and significance of French exceptionalism, the debate over U.S. hegemony, and the significance of European integration for European interstate relations. Finally, the course surveys the efforts to create a new order based upon common commitment to democratic governance and multilateral institutions, the reconstruction of norms of sovereignty and nonintervention, and the contending theories about the nature of the emerging European state system.

    :number: "229"
    :description: Australia has gradually recognized itself as a multicultural nation over the last fifty years. This course will explore dimensions of cultural practice derived from Aboriginal and European cultures as well as their interaction in contemporary Australia. Family life has long constituted a core institution for Australians of European descent. We will examine cultural images and practice of family relations with its associated gender roles through film, autobiography and ethnography. The religious practice of Australian Aborigines historically structured many aspects of indigenous life, including relations to land, other people and individual biography. We will examine these connections through the careful study of Aboriginal painting, body art and material decoration. Over the last fifty years, Australians of European and Aboriginal descent have disputed and negotiated with each other about the significance of race, family, religion and land in the colonial context. We will study the legacy of these conflicts in the everyday lives of contemporary Aborigines. The course will close by examining how these disputes acquired an international character in recent years as indigenous peoples from colonized nations across the globe have become aware of their common experiences and mobilized to improve their lives.

    :description: "This anthropology course provides an overview of the changing cultures, institutions, processes, and challenges in African societies, and it uses ethnographies to highlight some of the key socio-cultural issues now confronting Africans. There are three basic themes that run through the course and that help shape the materials presented: 1) a triple-heritage of Traditional African culture, Islamic culture, and Western Christendom exists, and accounts for the multiple, overlapping identities and continuities, and cultural adaptiveness all cross Africa; 2) the social institutions have a stable core, but they are also being reorganized as Africans attempt to preserve some aspects of existing structures, values and processes, while integrating other imported and global ones; and 3) many of the cultural conflicts and problems in contemporary Africa derive from the global-local interface, but must be approached in a fashion consonant with indigenous cultures and local-national needs. These are significant themes, some of which have been highly debated in the wider literatures of anthropology, social science, and political science. Yet, they become clearer as we examine a variety of cultures all across the Continent."

In their struggle to define a new religious identity, the English often explored the ways in which they differed not only from other Christians but also non-Christians. In this course we will read sixteenth- and seventeenth-century English plays which represent some of these concerns in their accounts of two non-Christian religious traditions: Judaism and Islam. We will consider the significance of these representations both to discover what the English thought about religious difference as well as what these thoughts reveal about English culture. We will also attend to the ways in which representations of religious difference intersect with early modern ideas of race and gender."

This course isolates the interaction between information technology and International Relations in order to focus an initial inquiry into the contemporary state of international affairs. How have digital technologies like the Internet changed relationships among states or non-state actors? Do these technologies alter power relations or reinforce existing power dynamics? Are we witnessing a global transformation of international politics?

    :description: The Pacific Ocean has historically been regarded as a vast and prohibitive void rather than an avenue for integration. Yet over the last five centuries motions of people, commodities, and capital have created important relationships between the diverse societies situated on the "Pacific Rim." This course examines the history of trans-Pacific interactions from 1500 to the present. It takes the ocean itself as the principal framework of analysis in order to bring into focus large-scale processes--migration, imperial expansion, cross-cultural trade, transfers of technology, cultural and religious exchange, and warfare and diplomacy. This "oceans connect" approach to world history brings these processes into sharp relief while also allowing for attention to the extraordinary diversity of cultures located within and around the Pacific.

    :description: "Political Economy and International Political Economy are fast growing fields of study that focus on the methodological and substantive intersection of economics and political science. This class emphasizes the methodological tools and techniques that underlie much of the current research in this field. These models and techniques allow us to structure our thinking about fundamental concepts regarding the nature of political and economic preferences, the problems of preference aggregation and the link between policy preferences and policy outcomes, problems of collective action, and strategic interaction. Mastering these tools and techniques is important for understanding the major works in the field and contributing to it. Students are expected to use these tools and techniques in courses throughout the PECO/IPEC majors to analyze substantive issues of the field (such as economic development, the politics of trade or finance, government-business relations, etc.). Most important, all students will be required to write a article-length research paper on a topic of their choosing during the spring of the senior year as part of PECO/IPEC401. In that paper, students are expected to apply the analytical techniques learned in this course and their statistics courses. Throughout the major, students are encouraged to keep a notebook of ideas and topics that they find interesting which could serve as the foundation of their PECO/IPEC401 paper. This course is team-taught by a political scientist and economist. Prerequisites: Microeconomic Theory (ECON-101) and one foundation government course.

First, it introduces the student to the cultures of the various communities that speak Swahili, either natively or as their basic language of business, or both. Second, the course introduces the student to KiSwahili, the language of the Swahili people. There are conflicting accounts of the origins of the Swahili culture. One theory asserts that Swahili Culture existed at the coast prior to the arrival and influence of foreign cultures. This view asserts that the Swahili people welcomed, and sometimes absorbed, foreigners into the local populations as the foreigners traveled southward along the East African coast. The \xE2\x80\x9Cnewcomers\xE2\x80\x9D gradually learned the local language and adapted it for trade and religion. Thus, Swahili spread southward and inland from its original \xE2\x80\x9Chome\xE2\x80\x9D in the southern part of modern day Somalia. Another theory holds that the Swahili culture and language resulted from intermarriages between the \xE2\x80\x9Cnewcomers\xE2\x80\x9D, mainly from Arabic countries, and the local Bantu peoples. In this theory, the Swahili people and language resulted from the \xE2\x80\x9Cmerging\xE2\x80\x9D of the different \xE2\x80\x9Craces\xE2\x80\x9D that came into contact due to trade, and so forth. One of this course\xE2\x80\x99s goals is to introduce students to KiSwahili, the language of the Swahili people, and one whose structure overwhelmingly places it in the Bantu language family.

    :description: "Outside of the Middle East, dealing with North Korea (DPRK) and its nuclear weapons programs is arguably the most important issue on the U.S. foreign policy agenda. This course would address the current crisis in U.S.-North Korea relations, including the effort in the Six-Party Talks to get North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions and to take other necessary steps to become a member in good standing of the international community. The course would look at the causes of hostility between the U.S. and DPRK, including the background of the Korean War, as well as relations between North Korea and its neighbors. It would also examine internal North Korean issues that have an important impact on the U.S.-DPRK relationship: the role of the Kim family, the juche (self reliance) and military-first philosophies, the human rights situation, and North Korea's attempts to come to terms with the economic impact of the fall of the Soviet Union. The course would give students the opportunity to evaluate U.S. strategies toward North Korea, which have ranged from engagement to isolation, and to consider new approaches to resolve the last vestige of the Cold War."

  - :name: Images of Eve
    :number: "399"
    :description: This course explores the definition, role, and presentation of women in the art of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Feminist scholars have suggested that the fundamental purpose for the imaging of women was to teach both theological doctrine and appropriate societal roles. Following this mode of analysis, we will consider the origin of the image of women in the art of Judaism, Christianity and Islam, and examine the relationship between the religious and the societal through visual culture. This course begins with an examination of the interrelationship between religion and art, and the unique interconnections which delineate this unique relationship in Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The lecture/discussions then focus on modules each devoted to an in-depth examination of the scriptural texts on the role of the visual modality, a chronological overview of the role of women in each tradition, and an analysis of the core relationship between the image of woman and the religious understanding of woman. Modules examining the special questions arising from the images and theology of Eve, Mary, and Fatima will be offered. The final class session will be devoted to the presentation of student research. Readings and class lectures/discussions will be divided between art historical and religious studies texts with an emphasis on the interdisciplinary nature of this form of academic study.

    :number: "434"
    :description: Taught by a U.S. Foreign Service Officer, this seminar will examine the emerging attention given to "fragile" or "weak" states by U.S. foreign policy-makers. Weak states, characterized by such features as limited political legitimacy and governmental authority, poor bureaucratic, regulatory and law enforcement capacity, and the existence of political or ethnic violence, are increasingly seen as potential threats to U.S. interests overseas. Such states may be exploited by transnational criminal or terrorist networks, while their unstable systems of government can give way to civil conflict or to authoritarian rule inimical to U.S. interests. Utilizing current policy documents, academic analysis, and case studies from Latin America and sub-Saharan Africa, this course will examine fragile states from the perspective of U.S. foreign policy. Initial readings and discussions will focus on the sources and characteristics of weak states and then consider the U.S. Governments' methods for identifying vulnerable states and developing a policy response. A series of case studies will be examined beginning with countries that have slipped from fragility into either conflict or less democratic governance. Governments in several poor developing countries will then be examined to analyze sources of fragility or governing stability. During the course, students will have the opportunity to interact with U.S. government policy-makers and non-governmnetal experts. Students will be expected to show significant initiative in identifying a specific fragile state and making concrete proposals for a modified U.S. policy toward that country.

A much smaller portion of the world\xE2\x80\x99s population--living primarily in Europe, North America, and Japan--is extraordinarily rich in historical terms. What explains this extraordinary discrepancy in wealth and well being? What are the ethical implications of global wealth and poverty? What have been the strategies, successes, and failures over the past half century of efforts on the part of poor countries, aided by rich ones, to develop their economies and societies in order to reduce poverty? What are the probable future challenges of ethics and global development? In Ethics and Global Development, School of Foreign Service Professor and Director of the Mortara Center International Studies Carol Lancaster will join President John J. DeGioia in analyzing some of the ethical and practical issues surrounding global poverty. Students will consider the extent and causes of global poverty, consider philosophical and religious sources of our obligation to the poor, and examine international efforts to promote poverty reduction and economic development. The course will include several prominent guest lecturers, which will give students the opportunity to interact with and learn from some of the foremost experts in the field of global development. In the past, speakers have included Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs, Copenhagen Consensus founder Bjorn Lomborg, and Father Bryan Hehir from the Harvard University Divinity School. Discussion sections will discuss and debate the issues presented in the lectures. Students will be encouraged to approach the morality and means of global poverty relief critically.

    :description: "The end of the authoritarian regime unleashed pent-up centripetal forces in Spain which had accumulated during the long processes of nation building and State building. This course will analyze the current cultural and political diversity of Spain by looking at the history of the country at several critical junctures. Students will learn the political nation building process initiated in C\xC3\xA1diz (1812) against the background of the much earlier state building process. Comparison with other major European countries will lead to understand the peculiarities of the Spanish case and will provide the grounds to understand why Spain became a counter-example in Europe. Using conventional theoretical frameworks explaining the rise of nationalism, the course will try to provide an explanation for the emergence of successful peripheral nationalisms in Spain during the 19th century and their impact upon the Spanish State and nation of the 20th century. In that way Students will learn about Spain\xE2\x80\x99s cultural and linguistic diversity in a democratic, quasi-federal regime, the institutions created to accommodate this diversity, and their functioning.

    :number: "381"
    :description: "Jewish communities, regardless of their different locations, have used language as a major marker of collective identity and group vitality (along with other variables such as history, ancestry and religion). The dominating linguistic pattern of Jews was often trilingual: the reading of Hebrew, the relevant territorial languages, and some Jewish language. This pattern kept changing over history, often related to political developments that brought about different language ideologies and practices, especially towards and after the establishment of the state of Israel: it was then that Hebrew began to serve as a major tool representing national ideologies of Jews and symbolizing the national collective identity of Jews immigrating to Palestine. It was also then that Zionist ideology struggled against other languages of the Jews, especially against Yiddish. Nowadays in Israel, Hebrew is the official language (along with Arabic), Yiddish is used only by Ultra Orthodox communities, and English is widespread in terms of its use (after Hebrew) in all domains of life. The course focuses on and explores the different languages used by Jewish communities in the context of political entities of nation-states and institutions (schools, communities, religious and cultural affiliations) in different places where Jews currently reside. It examines these issues in historical terms as well as in current linguistic landscapes. It surveys the multiple of Jewish languages used over the years, their relationship with collective and personal identities, and the role of these languages as expressions of cultural, religious and political environments. It will examine the methods of reviving spoken Hebrew, the struggle of Hebrew against other Jewish languages. It examines the current declared and de facto language policies of Israel, the role of Hebrew in the continuous effort to maintain a political homogenous national identity, the attitudes towards \xE2\x80\x98the other\xE2\x80\x99 languages (Arabic as well as immigrant languages), and the various Jewish languages currently emerging in different Jewish communities around the world.

Looking at major determinants of health and disease in different national contexts, the student will analyze the main transnational factors that influence the transfer of risks to health and the structural conditions that determines one country's vulnerability in a globalized economy."

    :description: The purpose of this course is to give students with an interest in political economy a brief survey of a number of different issues within this field. The hope is that the course will increase the interest for the field in general, but also help the students get an idea of what courses they may find interesting to take in the future. Among the topics covered will be a political economy perspective on issues such as growth, corruption, foreign aid, trade, transition and fiscal and monetary policy. The course is taught by an economist, which means that the material covered will include economic models and applied econometric work. The Econ-121, Economic Statistics course, is therefore a prerequisite, and it is required that you have taken, or is concurrently taking, the PECO-201 class.

    :description: "In this course we will talk about the political economy literature on growth, redistribution, income inequality and poverty. The bulk of the course is devoted to the political economy of growth, but the topics are clearly related, as you will see. Income inequality may have an impact on growth rates through incentives for redistribution, and growth may, or may not, have an impact on income inequality and poverty, etc. The purpose of the course is twofold. First of all I hope that you will leave this class with more knowledge about the impact of different political variables and institutions on growth rates, income inequality and poverty. Secondly, we will throughout the course go through some formal, but relatively simple, economic models and we will talk about papers that use econometrics to derive empirical regularities. The second purpose is thus to increase your understanding of an economists \xE2\x80\x9Ctool kit\xE2\x80\x9D, and to this end we start out the course with two lectures on the very crude basics of econometrics."

    :number: "201"
    :description: "Political Economy and International Political Economy are fast growing fields of study that focus on the methodological and substantive intersection of economics and political science. This class emphasizes the methodological tools and techniques that underlie much of the current research in this field. These models and techniques allow us to structure our thinking about fundamental concepts regarding the nature of political and economic preferences, the problems of preference aggregation and the link between policy preferences and policy outcomes, problems of collective action, and strategic interaction. Mastering these tools and techniques is important for understanding the major works in the field and contributing to it. Students are expected to use these tools and techniques in courses throughout the PECO/IPEC majors to analyze substantive issues of the field (such as economic development, the politics of trade or finance, government-business relations, etc.). Most important, all students will be required to write a article-length research paper on a topic of their choosing during the spring of the senior year as part of PECO/IPEC401. In that paper, students are expected to apply the analytical techniques learned in this course and their statistics courses. Throughout the major, students are encouraged to keep a notebook of ideas and topics that they find interesting which could serve as the foundation of their PECO/IPEC401 paper. This course is team-taught by a political scientist and economist. Prerequisites: Microeconomic Theory (ECON-101) and one foundation government course. Note that ECON-101 has Microeconomic Principles (ECON-001) and Elementary Calculus (MATH-035) as prerequisites."

Unfortunately, many students of international relations have at best a rudimentary understanding of military operations. This course is divided into four parts. The first section reviews causes of wars and the nature of security. Section two looks at how the use of force has evolved in modern history. In the third section, we examine critical issues in using force today, examining nuclear weapons, air power, logistics, and other elements of military force.

Like Dante's Divine Comedy, this human comedy was written not only to delight, but also to instruct by exploring both our spiritual and our natural environment. Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375), considered by some typically medieval and by others one of the first truly modern literary figures to emerge from the darkness of the Middle Ages into the light of the Renaissance, shows himself, as author of The Decameron, to be both a passionate believer and a passionate critic as he reconstructs society, destroyed by the Black Plague, through the perfection of his 100-fold narrative. Class discussions will focus on a close reading of the Decameron. Special class presentations will treat questions of Boccaccio's belief system as manifested in the Decameron, his sources and his imitators, and the sociocultural milieu in which he wrote. The Decameron will be read in its entirety in English translation. Conducted in English. This course satisfies one of the two literature and writing requirements of the College.

    :number: "321"
    :description: "Nonexistent knights, cloven viscounts, cosmicomics, the geography of the city and the universe: the production of the most experimental Italian writer of the 20th century engages in a dialogue with literary tradition, investigates the links between literature and science, and reflects on the mechanisms of textual creation and consumption. In the first of the Norton lectures that he was going to deliver at Harvard in 1985, Calvino described his working method as one involving \"the subtraction of weight\". The course explores the author's \"poetics of lightness\" through a thorough analysis of his work, from the war novel The Path to the Spiders' Nest (1947) to the textual adventures of If on a Winter Night a Traveler (1979).

  - :name: Giallo! Italian Detective Fiction
    :number: "360"
    :description: WHODUNIT? Italian literature begins to ask this question only in the 1930s, with the publication of the first libri gialli, which drew inspiration from British and American crime fiction. In this seminar, we will trace the extraordinary evolution of Italian detective fiction from its foreign antecedents and its early success in Italy's mass literary market to the later appeal exerted by the detective format upon mainstream contemporary male novelists, as well as upon their feminist re-writers. A study of the Italian giallo will allow us to explore how literature adopts the motif of crime to raise issues of justice, politics, and morality, how power is deployed in the struggle between mafia and the law, how the space of the city is connected with the space of the narrative, and how writers use the search for meaning to convey different ideas about knowledge and interpretation of reality, from the heroic discovery of truth to the postmodern anti-heroic failure to decipher clues and solve mysteries. Conducted in Italian.

  - :name: "Encounters with the Other: Ethnographic Imagination in Italian Literature"
    :number: "426"
    :description: This course is devoted to the Italian gaze at other cultures, to the different strategies of representations adopted by Italian authors in their writings about other cultures, and to the ideologies that accompany such discourse, in specific contexts and epochs. From the marvels of Marco Polo's voyage to the Far East and the travelogues of later explorers through the birth of anthropology as a discipline, from late nineteenth-century exoticism, primitivism, and the colonial experience through the geographical depaysement in novelists of the last decade, like Calvino, Tabucchi and Celati, we will examine how the encounter with cultural otherness, outside or inside the Italian borders, is verbalized and gradually incorporated into literature. We will also try to interrogate the relationship between this multifarious discourse on other cultures and the question of the Italian national identity. Conducted in Italian.

  - :name: Betrayals of Translation
    :number: "445"
    :description: "What lies behind the stereotype of the translator as a betrayer (as in the Italian pun \"traduttore traditore\")? This course aims to answer this question by concentrating on three major aspects on the craft of translation: history, theory, and practice. We will examine the role of translation in modern and contemporary culture and its complex relationship with the question of power, by studying major Italian writers who also achieved fame as translators of foreign masterpieces. Students will be introduced to a variety of theories of and approaches to translation, with attention to their historical development down to the current connections between translation and poststructuralist, postcolonial and gender studies. The promises and the pitfalls of translation as intercultural communication will then be tested through a series of meetings devoted to practicing translation, when students will work on English and Italian texts from and to the target language. Conducted in Italian. Open to Georgetown students and students of the Consortium. Prerequisite: solid knowledge of Italian."

  - :name: "The Writing Factory: Science, Machines, and the Technology of the Word in 20th-Century Italian Literature"
    :number: "471"
    :description: This course investigates the role played by science and technology as motifs and formal principles in Italian literature and culture from the end of the 19th century to the present. Adopting a comparative and interdisciplinary perspective, we will examine the position of Italian writers and intellectuals vis-a-vis the extended Western debate on the so-called "two cultures," we will meditate on the status of literature and the humanities in a technological society, and we will try to understand how and why writers incorporate the scientific discourse in their works. Pivotal moments will be the Futurist attack on nature and naturalism, the clash between theater and the rise of the cinema industry, the experimental literary techniques of the neo-avant-garde, the postmodern problematization of reason, method and meaning, the question of the ethics of literature in a rapidly evolving technological world, and the slowly-emerging cyberfeminist movement within feminist theory. Readings will include works by Marinetti, Pirandello, Levi, Sciascia, Calvino, and Del Giudice. Conducted some semesters in Italian and other semesters in English. This course, when taught in English, satisfies one of the two literature and writing requirements in the College.

    :description: "With the turn of the century and the new millennium, this course allows us to live through another fin-de-siecle experience, namely, the fascinating transition from the 19th to the 20th century. We will explore the multiple ways in which different literary and visual forms of representation reflect, react, and even anticipate the dramatic changes in the Italian philosophical, political, and social domains at the dawn of a new epoch, decreeing the death of realism. Pivotal issues: the exotic in decadent and colonial literature, the crisis of the hero and the will to power, the shock of the new, women writers' reaction to Fascist female stereotypes.

  - :name: Catholicism in Japanese Culture
    :number: "349"
    :description: Catholicism has a history in Japan longer than the United States has been around. Beginning with the arrival of St. Francis Xavier in 1549, Catholicism has shaped Japanese culture in subtle but profound ways. How many people realize that tempura has its origins in the dietary requirements of Jesuits during Lent (the tempora when meat was not to be eaten)? This course seeks to enrich our understanding of Japanese culture by challenging stereotypes of Japanese culture as either "non-religious" (materialistic) or "not-our-religious" (Buddhist, Confucian, etc). Simultaneously, it challenges Eurocentric views that reduce Catholicism to an expression of Western culture. Readings include historical texts, theological works, and novels (especially the novels by the Catholic writer, Endo Shusaku). Take a course at Georgetown that will introduce you to what St. Francis Xavier struggled with at the end of his life! Course and readings are in English.

    :number: "352"
    :description: "Many of us know Japan today through a hodgepodge of mass-produced goods and pop-culture images: cars, robots, electronic gadgets, karaoke singing, anime cartoons and video games. The arrival of these products on the world market, however, is just the latest development in the transformation of Japan from a largely peasant society to a highly urbanized, intricately managed, technology- and media-saturated one. Through historical readings as well as literature, film and ethnography, this course will trace the trajectory of that change from the late 19th century to the present, looking particularly at the impact of \"massification\" on culture. In the process, we will explore several approaches to conceptualizing mass society and its contemporary manifestations in Japan. Conducted in English."

    :number: "202"
    :description: "Is nonviolence a viable option for social and political change in today's world? Or is it merely an idealistic lifestyle choice? The word \"nonviolence\" is frequently misunderstood and abused, tending to be defined in the negative. It can be used in very narrow or broad constructs and can be based on a wide variety of philosophies and practices. This course will use numerous case studies, readings on philosophy, theology and strategy, and experiential exercises to examine the roots and directions of both principled and pragmatic ACTIVE nonviolence. The question remains: can struggle for a just world while at the same time, not use the methods of oppression? Can nonviolent struggle be effective? What's the difference between conflict resolution and nonviolent struggle? The format will be more of a seminar and participation will be expected. Each week, one student will present a 5 - 10 minute biography of a pacifist (based on his or her book review and/or informational interview) and two students will present a case study. You basically have four papers. The papers include a book review about a biography of a pacifist, an informational interview with a peacemaker, analysis of a nonviolent campaign, and the construction of a nonviolent campaign (group project)."

While there is broad consensus that there does exist a contemporary crisis around global violence and the suspected gendered aspect of it, how the relationships between globalization and human rights violations, and between violence against women and redefinition of human rights, are to be interpreted, and what is to be done about it is matters of vigorous intellectual and political debate. This class aims to explore the gendered manifestations of violence in public and private spheres within the context of the more general relationship among globalization, development, and human/civil/citizen rights. We will pay attention to banal violence (that is, daily and \xE2\x80\x9Cbanal\xE2\x80\x9D violence in everyday life), spectacular violence at moments of crisis, and the type of violence that disrupts the boundary between the two. Special emphases will be given to the issues of racism, sexual exploitation, poverty, labor, health care, homophobia, militarism, and globalization.

    :number: "272"
    :description: Greetings to you and welcome to an innovative new course designed to explore the interdisciplinary nature of Conflict Studies. Because conflict is an integral part of human experience, it can offer opportunity for growth and openings to instigate change. Many areas of scholarly inquiry can and do apply to Conflict Studies, making the integration of theory and research a necessity for practice in interpersonal, local, and global contexts. When working for social change it helps to understand the dynamics, functions, and practical choices involved in conflicting so that we are able to take advantage of opportunities and disrupt destructive conflict patterns. Social conflict often serves as a marker indicating injustice that simultaneously points towards potential benefits of change. In this upper level elective students will develop their capacities for theory building and research through interdisciplinary inquiry into conflict studies with a focus on social change. All interdisciplinary work is challenging and when the topics weave together multiple aspects of experience it is important to devise a thorough and flexible method of inquiry that will foster both critical thought and creativity.

How do development policies sometimes preserve, and at other times, transform gender relations? How have women been studied and incorporated/co-opted into the field of development? We will engage with the political economic context of neoliberal globalization, theories of development, and transnational and postcolonial feminist critiques. This involves critically examining the founding binaries of the field, such as 'first world/third world', 'traditional/modern', 'productive/reproductive labor' and 'global/local.' Our readings include case studies of how women cope with, and resist, economic and social injustice. Topics addressed are (a) poverty alleviation strategies, micro credit and fair trade movements (b) population policies and reproductive rights (c) global assembly line work (d) tourism and the sex trade (e) AIDS and (f) the environment and sustainable development.

While there is broad consensus that there does exist a contemporary crisis around global violence and the suspected gendered aspect of it, how the relationships between globalization and human rights violations, and between violence against women and redefinition of human rights, are to be interpreted, and what is to be done about it is matters of vigorous intellectual and political debate. This class aims to explore the gendered manifestations of violence in public and private spheres within the context of the more general relationship among globalization, development, and human/civil/citizen rights. We will pay attention to banal violence (that is, daily and \xE2\x80\x9Cbanal\xE2\x80\x9D violence in everyday life), spectacular violence at moments of crisis, and the type of violence that disrupts the boundary between the two. Special emphases will be given to the issues of racism, sexual exploitation, poverty, labor, health care, homophobia, militarism, and globalization. The readings will include _We Wish to Inform you That Tomorrow We will be Killed with Our Families: Stories from Rwanda_ by Philip Gourevitch, _A Problem from Hell_ by Samantha Powers, _Violence against Women_ by Stanley French et al., _Are Prisons Obsolete_ by Angela Davis, _The Sterilization of Carrie Buck_ by J. David Smith and K. Ray Nelson, and _Pathologies of Power: Health, Human rights, and the New War on the Poor_ by Paul Farmer."

  - :name: Labor, Globalization, and Sexuality
    :number: "224"
    :description: This course explores the junctures of globalized labor, national "development," and the "postcolonial" world system by exploring the concepts of labor, sexuality, and bodies. When and how do we become "workers"? How do we imagine and represent sexualities and bodies in the contexts of national developments and policy making procedures? How do third world workers negotiate their agency from the positionality of the "subaltern"? We will read and discuss literary and cultural texts, fact-finding documents, and theoretical investigations so that the more rigorously historicized concepts of labor, sexuality, and globalization enhance our understanding of social justice, equality, and violence prevention. This is a student-centered, process-oriented seminar in which students work individually and in groups to prepare written and oral reports and critiques. Each student is asked to make two oral presentations and to write a short essay (3-5 pages) and a longer term paper (8-10 pages).

The course will meet as a weekly seminar to discuss readings and to develop students' research projects. Students' research will focus on social justice issues such as health care, housing, education, economic development, education, and violence prevention. These projects will be developed collaboratively with a community partner, in consultation with the professor. A number of projects will be suggested, but students are also allowed to develop their own projects (for example, with community service programs with which they already work). The research projects should be related to the organization or agency's social change, policy, or program goals. The course begins with a brief overview of the problem areas, principles, and practices of community-based research, and potential sites. The student, professor, and site supervisors will work out the details of the student's placement during the first two weeks of the course. Students will be expected to conduct research, produce policy option/position papers, and possibly arrange workshops for policy-makers, academics, and interested community partners. Students are expected to work with the community organization one day per week (80 hours per semester). This two-semester course is required for Social and Justice Analysis majors and minors, and may be substituted for the Sociology department's Pre-Thesis Seminar, SOCI 303, and Senior Seminar, SOCI-304. Prerequisite: SOCI-201 or permission of the instructor required. This course is cross-listed as a Psychology course. Fall (437) and Spring (438)."

What are poetics of oral poetry: how is it composed; what makes the poet's job easy or hard? Is there a difference between oral and written poetry? And, what kinds of changes does a tradition undergo as it matures or deteriorates? Students take up three interconnected themes in relation to each: the hero's \"beautiful death\" and the poetics of return; heroes as performers/poets; and \"dangerous voices\"\xE2\x80\x94women in a man's world. Finally these epics endure as monumental reflections on learning to question both how they frame the issues and how they answer them.

  - :name: The Ethics of Aristotle and Kant
    :number: "392"
    :description: Ethics is a context-dependent study. Theories about what we should do and what we should not do rely heavily on beliefs about what it means to be human and what it is that we can know. Philosophers who agree about what we should do may disagree deeply about why we should do it. More troubling, philosophers who disagree about what we ought to do cannot find the common ground from which to address the disagreement. Ethics, therefore, looks like a discipline that cannot get its own house in order and, as a consequence, is in no position to instruct others on that subject. This course will examine how beliefs about human nature and the possibility of knowledge influenced the development of the ethical theories of Aristotle and Kant. We hope to see that any convincing standard of our conduct will not be an isolated and disconnected moral code but rather the spelling out of the implications of our beliefs about what we are.

John Marshall, not Jefferson, laid the groundwork for the modern American nation by articulating decidedly non-Jeffersonian concepts in Marbury and McCulloch. Earl Warren, not Congress or the President, implemented the Second Reconstruction through Brown v. Board of Education. Warren Burger toppled a vast criminal enterprise operated out of the Oval Office by saying, in essence, the emperor has no executive privilege clothes (United States v. Nixon). Other issues include the Commerce Power; the constitutional twilight zone (Presidential warmaking short of war); the Court's foray into intra-branch warfare (which led to FDR's Court-Packing Plan); the Court's employment of the "equal protection" clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to cut the Gordian knot of racial apartheid, and also to create "penumbral" constitutional rights found nowhere in the text of the document.

    :number: "408"
    :description: Using issues about the relation of religious beliefs and moral convictions, this course will provide an introduction to basic moral concepts. Students will examine the relation of moral teachings to the broader theological or philosophical framework in which they occur, analyze positions taken by religious moralists on particular issues, and compare those positions with those of secular thinkers. The course will not develop any particular theological position in the examination of selected issues; rather it will consider the worldview and position of representative religious and secular thinkers on these issues. Additionally, the students will consider arguments for and against moral absolutes, the so-called "situation ethics" debate. With this foundation, this course will apply these principles to specific moral issues such as war, sexuality, abortion, and euthanasia.

    :number: "412"
    :description: Originating with and still profoundly influenced by Sigmund Freud, contemporary psychotherapeutic theory and practice give rise to new images of the good human life. Some of these images challenge older images maintained for centuries by religious traditions of the West, Christian and Jewish. The course examines these images and the extent to which a traditional religious understanding can assimilate positively some of the new psychotherapeutic perspectives and evolve to a fresh, but still genuinely religious, view of human life.

    :description: "Students will have an opportunity to take up directly the question of democracy\xE2\x80\x99s future by a selective examination of its evolution in the Modern period. The theory and practice of democracy have established a dialectic between themselves over time: the expectations of theory become subject to amendment as experience with democracy accumulates. Classical theorists of modern democracy, such as J.S. Mill, would neither recognize nor approve of what democracy has become. Contemporary theorists are divided over justifying existing democratic practices and the contrary effort of establishing nobler standards by which to measure democratic life. This reaffirmation of democratic idealism seeks to extend democracy beyond the political sphere into the workplace and within the family."

    :number: "449"
    :description: For centuries the Bible has been recognized as a primary source for ethical and theological teachings, but recent years have seen a renewed appreciation for the Bible as a work of literature. This course will explore the literary artfulness of the Bible, and students will gain the skills needed to fully appreciate both the poems and the narratives that constitute so much of the biblical canon. The style of biblical literature often differs greatly from that of modern, Western literature; for example, the poems almost never rhyme and, unlike the modern novel, the narratives almost never give readers a glimpse of the inner life or thought process of the characters in a story. By learning what is distinctive about biblical literature, students will begin to read the Bible with new eyes and may also come to fresh insights about the theological and ethical dimensions of these texts as well.

Bioethical issues tend to cluster at the beginning and the end of the human life span, though some issues such as justice and access to health care are important to human beings of all ages. This survey course encourages students to use basic forms of ethical reasoning to analyze issues such as: prenatal diagnosis and the uses of genetic information, assisted reproduction, the interest rights and responsibilities of human research subjects, organ and tissue transplantation, the use of life-sustaining technologies and interfaces with euthanasia, access to scarce resources, and the extent and implications of any moral commitment to universal access to health care.

    :number: "470"
    :description: What health-care goods, if any, ought to be subject to allocation by the market? The current political and social climate is one in which market-based approaches to all social issues, including health care, have become the norm. However, some views within moral philosophy, as well as a fairly substantial tradition of social thought, have argued that some goods ought not be treated as market commodities, e.g. that health care ought to be distributed according to need, not income. Some argue that some types of health or health-care goods, such as organs or reproductive services/products, ought to be excluded from market distribution. The class will examine proposed moral justifications for and against markets in health care as well as arguments meant to determine conditions under which markets, suitably regulated, are morally acceptable. The class will also discuss which persons or which services ought to be an exception to the use of markets as the basis for distributing health care.

    :description: Author P.D. James declared in an interview for Paris Review that, "I had an interest in death from an early age. It fascinated me. When I read, 'Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall,' I thought, 'Did he fall or was he pushed?'" This course explores classic tales written by American and English writers about those who pushed and were pushed. In so doing, the course focuses on the ways in which detective fiction both reflects and challenges cultural values, including views of race, gender, class, ethnicity, and age. As noted by writer Amanda Cross, "formula fiction," which includes the detective novel, has "with astonishing success challenged the oldest formulas of all," such as those focused on gender roles and patriarchal traditions. Detective Fiction and Cultural Values begins with Edgar Allan Poe, widely credited with establishing the genre of detective fiction, and concludes with P.D. James, one of the finest detective writers of her generation.

It is not assumed that entering students have a basis in philosophy or evolution. However, students are expected to entertain a serious curiosity about whether ethics and human culture may ultimately be nothing more than mere reflections of natural selection.

This course introduces students to the literature and culture of the Greeks and Romans, with particular attention paid to texts whose influence will be seen in later parts of the curriculum. It includes a brief overview of the history and geography of the ancient Mediterranean world and includes some discussion of material culture, but its primary focus is textual. The course aims to introduce students to some of the major genres of writing to come out of the ancient Mediterranean, with special emphasis placed on epic, tragedy, comedy, historiographical prose, and philosophy. Although philosophical texts are taught as a separate segment, they will be read as part of a broader ancient discussion, played out in other genres as well, of questions of justice, freedom, and the like. Given the nature of the texts read, students will require grounding in the basics of ancient Greek and Roman religion and ritual practice. Since this will be one of the first literary courses taken by students, special focus will be placed on close reading and analysis. This course may be a student's first course in the BALS Core.

    :description: "BALS students only. The relation between faith and reason is one of the perennial issues in Western thought. With the renaissance of the twelfth century and the founding of universities throughout Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the question of faith and reason was dramatically recast. The rediscovery of Aristotle\xE2\x80\x94and so, the use of Aristotelian logic, grammar, physics, and metaphysics\xE2\x80\x94led to the development of new methods of inquiry, categories of thought, and modes of expression. This course begins with the twelfth-century renaissance; the cross-fertilization among Muslim, Jewish, and Christian scholars; the rise of the universities as important institutions; and the development of scholasticism. It focuses on particular on the development of the scholastic method, resistance to it, and, in particular, discussions and sometimes fierce debates about \xE2\x80\x9Cfaith and reason\xE2\x80\x9D in Christianity and Judaism. The course also looks at the issue of authority and alternative approaches to faith and reason (e.g., mystical texts and vernacular theologies), the category of \xE2\x80\x9Cheresy\xE2\x80\x9D and its ramifications (social, political, religious)."

As we engage the ancient Romans, some other questions of a broader dimension will be addressed in order to establish a philosophical or ideological framework, as it were, and to indicate the many implications associated with the theory, practice, and historiography of slavery. While the reading list is quite varied in scope and theme, I cannot emphasize enough the crucial need for students to familiarize themselves with the primary sources (i.e., Plautus and the texts in Wiedemann). It is imperative that we distinguish, as much as possible, what the ancients themselves practiced and thought of slavery from the interpretations of more modern investigators.

Particular emphasis will be placed on looking at how \xE2\x80\x9Ctradition\xE2\x80\x9D was challenged, rejected, reconciled and/or maintained, as well as assessing the costs and benefits associated with the various alternatives. While the paths followed by these two countries over the course of the last century and a half were not determined entirely by their contact with the \xE2\x80\x9Cmodern\xE2\x80\x9D world, clearly such interaction played a role in shaping China and Japan\xE2\x80\x99s current conditions. The course\xE2\x80\x99s texts will focus on the history of these nations and draw from contemporary works, fiction and non-fiction. By examining the experiences of Japan and China, this course will provide students with an understanding of two of the present-day world\xE2\x80\x99s most important nations.

  - :name: Introduction to Language
    :number: "001"
    :description: "Every year dozens of Georgetown students enroll in this introductory Linguistics course. In order to give our students a more personal, individualized class experience, we have organized Introduction to Linguistics as a multi-section course; each section has approximately 25 students. This makes the course rather different from many introductory courses with large enrollments, which often have large lectures formats, supplemented with smaller, weekly discussion sections (typically led by a team of graduate students). Each section of LING 001 is taught by a different instructor, but all instructors follow the same basic course policies and a partially shared syllabus. This allows for a good balance of comparability and individuality across the sections. For example, all sections use the same textbooks and teach the same topics in structural linguistics during the first half of the course, but each instructor teaches these topics in his or her own way. All sections have the same number of homework assignments (which make the same contribution toward the course grade), but the assignments vary to match the instruction of each section. All sections have a midterm during the same two week period, as well as either a final exam or a final project at the end of the semester. After the midterm, each section\xE2\x80\x99s topics vary to allow each instructor to share his or her individual expertise, areas of research interest, and enthusiasm. All sections share the same evaluation framework. Our instructors are carefully selected, trained and directed. They are dedicated, knowledgeable linguists who are eager to share their knowledge (and sense of wonder) about language with you. The instruction team for the course includes regular faculty, as well as adjuncts and advanced graduate students. Our adjunct faculty have all completed their doctorates in linguistics and have taught this and/or other undergraduate courses before. Our advanced graduate student instructors have served as teaching assistants for this and/or other undergraduate courses before and completed a year-long teaching practicum. One of the regular faculty instructors coordinates the sections\xE2\x80\x94 selecting, guiding, and observing the graduate and adjunct instructors. GENERAL OUTLINE AND POLICIES Introduction to Language provides a general introduction to the field of Linguistics, the scientific study of language. The main goals of the course are to begin to think about language analytically, apply methods of linguistic analysis, and become more aware of the important issues related to language and society. Along the way, we will also challenge some commonly held misconceptions about language. Through course readings, lectures, class discussions, exercises, and group projects, the class will address the following questions: * What is language? * How can language be studied systematically? * What are the subsystems of language, and how do they articulate with each other? * How do language use and culture interact? COURSE THEMES 1. Language as System: What do we know? 2. Analyzing Language Systematically: How do we know and how do we learn more? 3. Contextualizing Linguistics: How is what we know relevant? Evidence of cognitive structures and processes Evidence of social structures and processes Equality of languages and value of linguistic/cultural diversity COURSE GOALS 1. To gain a basic understanding of the complexity and underlying systematicity of language. 2. To perform basic analysis of linguistic data. 3. To apply this knowledge to better understand a relevant body of language data. 4. To relate linguistic knowledge and analysis to \xE2\x80\x98real life\xE2\x80\x99 issues COURSE MATERIALS Texts: (1) Fasold & Connor-Linton, An Introduction to Language and Linguistics (ILL) (2) Language Files, 9th Edition (LF) Additional readings will be made available during the semester. EVALUATION Homework Assignments (8 X 5%) 40% Midterm Exam 30% Group Project/Final 20% Class Participation 10% COURSE POLICIES -Attendance is required at all classes; please inform your instructor of a necessary absence ahead of time. If you have more than three unexcused absences, your final grade will be lowered by half a grade (e.g. from A to A-). You are responsible for material covered and homework assigned during any absence. -All assigned readings must be completed by the day we begin the topic in class. Being prepared is a component of the attendance and participation grade. -All homework assignments are due at the beginning of class. Except under extraordinary and unavoidable circumstances, late homework will not be accepted. Homework assignments help us to see how well you understand course concepts and are not collaborative. -As part of your class participation you will make a brief (five-minute) in-class presentation on a current news item related to language and linguistics, explaining why you think the news item is relevant to the course and/or how what we have learned in the course might help us to better understand the news item. Bring enough copies of the news item for everyone on the day you are assigned to present. -All students are expected to take the midterm exam in class on the date listed in the syllabus. The midterm exam is not collaborative. -The University Honor Code will be strictly enforced. According to the University Honor Code (www.georgetown.edu/honor), \xE2\x80\x9CWithout regard to motive, student conduct that is academically dishonest, evidences lack of academic integrity or trustworthiness, or unfairly impinges upon the intellectual rights and privileges of others is prohibited.\xE2\x80\x9D Prohibited conduct includes cheating on exams and other assignments, committing plagiarism, using false citations, submitting work for multiple purposes without prior permission of the relevant instructors, submitting false data, falsifying academic documentation, abuse of library privileges, and abuse of shared electronic media.

Besides examining everyday social interaction (between friends, couples, parents and children, and so forth), we will look at a variety of activities, including service encounters, job interviews, interactions in corporate settings, social scientific interviews, classroom interaction, and legal contexts. Research on intercultural communication has tried to identify implicit expectations in conversational behavior which vary from group to group, and which create interactional tension when these groups interact. (The term \xE2\x80\x9Cintercultural\xE2\x80\x9D is used broadly here to refer to any group-relative difference, not only to difference in terms of race, ethnicity, or national origin.) Our goal during this semester is to examine this literature and to understand how problems involving intercultural communication play out in everyday life. No prerequisites. COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING POLICIES Regular Class Participation (20% of grade [10% in class, 10% in discussion sections]): For each class, one or two students will be assigned the role of discussion leader. You will be expected to lead the class for approximately 10 minutes on one assigned reading for that day (drawing on your personal experiences, an article in the news, an academic article, a movie, and so forth). All the other students will be required to participate in class activities, even when not presenting. You are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the readings assigned for that day. A participation grade will be given for each class. Attendance: Regular class attendance is mandatory. Roll will be taken each class. You are allowed a maximum of 2 unexcused absences during the semester, after which your final participation grade will be lowered. If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out what has been covered in class. You are also expected to come to class on time. Repeated tardiness will be counted as an absence. Discussion sections are mandatory. During discussion sections, you will have the chance to improve your knowledge on the readings by discussing them further with your classmates and with your TA. You are required to actively participate in the activities that the TA will create for you, and you will have the chance to review the material covered in class. Discussion sections constitute 10% of your final participation grade. Reading summaries/responses (15% of grade): For each class, you will write a short summary and a short commentary of the readings assigned for that day (1 page maximum, double-spaced). You will be required to turn these in at the beginning of each class. At the end of the semester, the summary/response assignment with the lowest grade will be dropped; your grade for this component of the course will then be determined from the remaining set. Fieldnotes (10% of grade): For each Wednesday, you will be required to write fieldnotes on the topics of the weekly readings. The idea is to identify phenomena described in the readings and lectures in your own lives. (1 page maximum, double-spaced; details to be described in class). The final grade for your fieldnotes will be calculated by dropping the lowest grade at the end of the semester. Fieldwork Project with Two Status Reports (20% of grade): You are required to collect, transcribe, and analyze data related to the theme of this course. These data should be collected in the Georgetown campus area and with consent from your informants and from your instructor. This material should serve as the foundation for the final paper. You can pursue any topic of your interest as long as it is related to the assigned readings, and as long as your topic is approved by the instructor. Sample topics will be described in class. You will present your final fieldwork project to the class during the last few class meetings (15 minutes per presentation, maximum). For all presentations, I encourage you to be creative and to use any media you wish to use. Please let me know any AV requirements you might need for your class presentation well in advance. You may want to visit the following website for more information: http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/gelardin/ Twice during the semester (weeks 5 and 10; see schedule below), you will be required to provide a status report on your fieldwork project. This should be 2 pages in length (double-spaced). It can offer details about the fieldsite, the participants, preliminary analysis and findings, and so forth. Your grade for the fieldwork project will be calculated based on the final presentation of the project (15%) and on the 2 project reports (5%). Final Paper (10 pages; 35% of grade): Students are required to write a final paper of no less than 10 pages, doubled spaced, with 1 inch margins, and in a reasonably sized font (i.e., Times New Roman, 12 pt.). The final paper should first describe the findings from the fieldwork project, and then bring in relevant readings from the class to contextualize the findings. The papers are to be sent to me electronically (in MS Word format) or may be put in my departmental mailbox no later than December 12th, 2007 at noon. No late papers will be accepted. Grading You will receive a point-based grade on all written assignments. Your final grade will be calculated based on the 2006\xE2\x80\x932007 Undergraduate University Bulletin (http://www.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/regulations3.html): A+ = 4.33* B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33 A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 A- = 3.67 B- = 2.67 C- = 1.67 F = 0.00 *While you may receive an A+ on an individual assignment, you may not receive an A+ as a final grade. Any final numeric grade over 4.00 will be considered an A. Honor System Any instance of plagiarism or cheating will be reported and treated according the Georgetown University\xE2\x80\x99s Honor System.

    :description: This course will introduce students to the basics of natural language processing (NLP), a field which combines insights from linguistics and computer science to produce applications like machine translation, information retrieval, and spell checking. We will cover a range of topics that will help students understand how current NLP technology works and will provide students with a platform for future study and research. We will move from simple representations of language, such as finite-state techniques and n-gram analysis, to more advanced representations, such as those found in context-free and unification-based parsing. Students who take this course will gain a thorough understanding of the fundamental methods used in natural language understanding, along with an ability to assess the strengths and weaknesses of natural language technologies based on these methods.

  - :name: "Discourse Analysis: Narrative"
    :number: "483"
    :description: "Narratives have been studied by many different disciplines: literary theory, clinical, cognitive and developmental psychology, folklore, anthropology, sociology and linguistics. The primary focus of this course is the sociolinguistic study of narrative through discourse analysis. Our initial attention is spontaneous oral narratives told during conversations or conversation-like interactions. However, we will also compare and contrast stories that are written and electronically communicated. Likewise, although our discussions and analyses will dwell primarily on narrative told by one person, in one place, and at one time, in everyday life, we will also touch on narratives that develop across time, places and persons. We begin by discussing basic features of discourse analysis and sociolinguistic frameworks for the study of narrative, while collecting and transcribing narratives for our own analyses. We then turn to how different parts of language (e.g. tense, referring terms, reported speech) are used to create a story world, and how that story world both constructs, and reflects, different facets of context (including identity, relationships and social interaction). Included will be discussion of very short stories, long life stories, public stories, retold performances of stories, intertextual stories, and the infiltration of the notion of \xE2\x80\x9Cnarrative\xE2\x80\x9D into therapy, medicine, politics, history, law and business. COURSE REQUIREMENTS -Data (1) Tape and transcribe one narrative (with at least 4 narrated \xE2\x80\x98events\xE2\x80\x99); include a few lines of its surrounding conversation (2) Ask for three more versions of the oral narratives, in which the person (a) tells the story again, (b) emails you the story and (b) writes the story. (3) We will combine all the narratives into a class corpus. -Complete readings (articles, book chapters). We will review and discuss readings in class: what do the readings tell us about the topic of interest? how do they continue (or alter) previous work? how can we use the ideas to analyze our narratives? Bring the readings to class on their assigned date. -Complete 4 exercises (2- 3 pp. each). Exercises require application of the readings to your data and/or to class data. Be prepared to discuss your exercises in class on the day on which they are due. After class discussion, you should post your exercises on Blackboard for a class archive. No late submissions accepted! -Final paper (8- 10 pages) that integrates issues raised in the readings with data analysis GRADING Grades are based on exercises, final paper, and contributions to class. Each exercise counts for 15% of your grade (total 60%), the final paper counts for 30%, and class contributions for the remaining 10%.

    :description: "This course explores task-based approaches to second/foreign language learning and teaching using the following organizational principles: (a) the theoretical underpinnings for task-based language learning; (b) the key components of task-based program design; (c) cognitive-interactionist research frameworks for the evaluation of tasks as learning tools; (d) the process of developing and empirically testing task-based materials; (e) practical classroom considerations for the use/implementation of tasks in an instructional context. Students will participate in instructor- and student-led discussions, complete short homework assignments, explore and analyze existing task-based language programs, and carry out a final project on communicative tasks in either a classroom or experimental context. This course can be taken as a regular graduate class (LING-494) or as a graduate seminar (LING-558). The syllabus and meeting times will be the same for each class, but seminar participants will undertake a final project that is more substantial in scope. COURSE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Aims: The aim of this course is to introduce participants to issues, both practical and theoretical, surrounding task-based language learning and teaching. Objectives: Participants will gain an understanding of the issues at the core of task-based language teaching (TBLT) and, as a result, be able to contribute to the current discussion and practice in TBLT. In addition, participants will develop (a) their ability to engage in academic discussions by facilitating and participating in in-class discussions and (b) their critical thinking and writing skills by carrying out the class assignments. Seminar participants will show a greater understanding of, and ability to discuss, issues related to TBLT than participants taking the course as a regular graduate class."

  - :name: Ethnography of Communication
    :number: "495"
    :description: "The ethnography of communication documents and analyzes communicative practices and investigates how they fit into broader social context. Such communicative practices run the gamut from ritual invocations to ancestral spirits to idle gossip, and from complex peace negotiations to the conventional \xE2\x80\x98hello\xE2\x80\x99. Ethnographers of communication also examine the complexities of communication between observers and the people they study. This course provides both theoretical and hands-on experience with a range of different methods for collecting data on communication and language in social context. The fieldwork will take place in Washington, DC metropolitan area, where small groups of students select a communication site as their primary fieldwork area. As a researcher in training, you may choose any site to develop your project, including a classroom, courtroom, corporation, health care clinic, mediation center, airport, church, fitness center, AIDS residential facility, post office, Congress, soup kitchen, restaurant, support group, library or any other. Through your fieldwork, you will learn about ethnography (participant observation), structured observations, interviews, narrative/oral history and rapid anonymous surveys. Our understanding of the value of each method will be enhanced through mini-phenomena frequently studied by sociolinguists and communication specialists, and discussion and assessment of each method in terms of issues such as \xE2\x80\x9Crecord\xE2\x80\x9D keeping (e.g. field notes vs. checklists), objectivity/subjectivity, transcription, coding, and the relationship between theory and methodology. Students will also gain hands-on experience with other types of data (e.g. videotape, internet) and carry out analysis based on that data. Course requirements include participation in class discussions, reading articles that are based on different types of data, discussion of the fieldwork, completion of the fieldwork project, a personal journal (recounting and evaluating your fieldwork and its specific phases/projects), and a group report on your field study. This course is suitable for CCT and Linguistics students, and any student with some familiarity with language and communication (with instructor\xE2\x80\x99s permission). Requirements: audio-recorder."

    :description: "Classical Arab phoneticians: Ling-711-01 Spring 2007 Prof: Solomon Sara, S.J. Class: Telephone : (202)-687-6226/4004 ICC. 204A O.hs: (ICC 475) Mon & Wed 2:00-2:40 p.m. W 4:15-6:45 p.m. by appointment: anytime saras@georgetown.edu Topic of the seminar: The topic of the seminar will be the Arab linguists who explicitly dealt with phonetic/ phonological issues. Treatises and sections of treatises that deal with phonetic/ phonological issues will be the topics for discussion. The seminar will emphasize the study of the earliest Arab phoneticians . The discussion will focus on the primary sources themselves. There are certain primary texts that come to us from the eighth century that are seminal for any discussion of the phonetics and phonology of Arabic. The two 8th century authors who were the architects of Arabic linguistics are Al-Khal?l and S?bawayh. Both have included in their linguistic writings detailed phonetic/ phonological treatises on Arabic that defined the parameters of these two sub-disciplines for subsequent centuries. Other authors, like Ibn Duraid and Ibn Sina 10th century , may be discussed in the seminar as time will permit. Purpose: To explore the origins and the development of the phonetic/ phonology in a new paradigm. When approaching a new tradition in linguistics, the challenge is to determine what makes that tradition original and unique in its contributions. What is of interest in this seminar, then, is to capture the creative genius of these linguists in providing the technical terminology and the analytical tools for the study of Arabic that are unique to this tradition. The task of this seminar will be to study their texts, explore their language data, isolate their technical terms, examine their procedures, capture their theoretical orientation, and evaluate the results of their efforts in the context of the overall linguistic theory and the study of Arabic in particular. Procedures: Seminars of this type are successful when the participants, without prejudice, tackle the problems, analyze the text, disentangle the underlying theoretical assumptions, and frame their results within the context of the language that is being analyzed. The success of this seminar will depend on the participation and contributions of all the members. Pre-requisites: Interest in the history of linguistics and interest in the Arab linguistic tradition. Knowledge of Arabic is Not required. All relevant Arabic sources will be provided in translation. Members of the seminar will be assigned sections of the texts for presentation, analysis, and discussion. Even though all members of the seminar will be responsible for all the texts, the more effective method of participation is to have a leader of the discussion for each meeting who will summarize the appropriate texts, present the issues discussed in that section, analyze it, and lead the subsequent discussion. Papers: Seminar evaluations do not depend on exams that require mastery of the basic materials. The evaluations depend on active participation in the seminar meetings, and original personal contributions to the topic of the seminar. Each member of the seminar will be required to write two short and one long final seminar papers on a phonetic/phonological topic both assigned and of their choice. The topic can be drawn from the materials discussed in class or may be analyses of phonetic/ phonological topics of a linguist from the same period not discussed specifically in class. Decision on the topic, with consultation with the professor, will be due by the beginning of march.

    :description: "How do speakers use pitch changes to encode lexical and phrasal contrasts? What kind of representation should linguists use to talk about it? Linguists look at tone and intonation from many different angles: \xE2\x80\xA2 Sociolinguists may want to discuss intonational meaning in discourse contexts. \xE2\x80\xA2 Applied linguists may want to study how to help language learners in the difficult task of producing natural intonation contours. \xE2\x80\xA2 Computational linguists may want to improve the generation or recognition of intonation in computer-generated speech. \xE2\x80\xA2 Phonologists may be interested in how the representation of pitch contrasts and rules can be integrated into phonological theory. \xE2\x80\xA2 Syntacticians and sematicists may want to study the way intonation can change syntactic and lexical meanings. The goal of this class is bring together linguists representing all of these different viewpoints, to investigate the data, to read current relevant articles, and to work toward a common vocabulary for further research. Topics to be covered (especially the balance between tone and intonation) will depend in part on the interests of the participants, but major areas of interest should include: I. Phonetics of tone and intonation. How are pitch contrasts made? How can we measure them? II. The data. What are the possible patterns of lexical pitch contrast? What are the possible tonal rules? How should they be represented? What are the possible patterns of phrasal pitch contrast? How do languages differ in the use of intonation? How should intonational contrasts be represented? III. Intonational meaning. How do patterns of intonation get used? IV. Interactions. Do tone and intonation interact? How can we represent the interaction? Requirements: reading, class participation, class presentations, final paper. Ling 713. Seminar on Tone and Intonation.

    :description: "Course Description: LING 520: \xE2\x80\x9CGesture and Language\xE2\x80\x9D This course will explore gesture and its relationship to language. Gesture, the spontaneous body movements accompanying speech, has been claimed in recent years to be an integral part of spoken language, but much remains to be learned. This course will appeal to linguists of all disciplines. Theoretical linguists strive to discover and understand gestural correlates of sound (in gesture\xE2\x80\x99s case, motion), form, and meaning. Sociolinguists investigate how gesture regulates interaction and frames meaning in discourse, and how this pragmatic context shifts between cultures. Applied linguists examine how skilled communicators produce and perceive gestures in such varied settings as education, business, medicine, and the law. Cognitive linguists study gesture and speech together to better identify the origin and development of thought processes. Computational linguists develop next-generation human-computer interfaces which not only recognize and interpret human gestures alongside speech, but also use avatars (virtual humans) to generate speech-synchronized gestures. The course will first survey classic studies of gesture, gesture classification schemes, and the lively debate on the function of gesture in relation to language. The class will then cover a variety of topics tailored to student interest, including but not limited to: gesture and sign language, gesture as a possible origin of human language, gesture variation across cultures, acquisition of gesture and language, rhythm in gesture and speech, and gesture in human-computer interfaces. Guest lecturers from several institutions will amplify these topics. The course will also include a hands-on section, in which students will use digital video annotation tools to analyze gesture and language in a research topic of their own choosing. The instructor, Dan Loehr, is a computational linguist at The MITRE Corporation and an adjunct lecturer at Georgetown. His research interests include the relationship between gesture and intonation in terms of structure, meaning, and timing, the development of multimodal human-computer interfaces, the variation of gesture across cultures, and the creation of annotated gesture corpora to support all of these endeavors."

  - :name: Power, Solidarity, and Gender in Family Discourse
    :number: "523"
    :description: This seminar is designed to provide training in advanced discourse analysis in the interactional sociolinguistic mode, using family interaction as a research site. Anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod notes that "The family ... is the prototype of hierarchical relationships." It is also the prototype of close relationships--as well as of gender relations. Thus the focus on family interaction provides occasion for delving into the theoretical frameworks of power and solidarity as well as gender and language. We will also examine other current theoretical frameworks such as intertextuality and identity. Readings will include classic and current theoretical and methodological work and also review the existing literature on family interaction in linguistics and related disciplines. In addition, we will consider the effects of technological advances such as cellphones, email and IM on interpersonal interaction and hence relationships. Seminar members will collect and analyze discourse data, which could take the form of audiotaped or videotaped face to face interaction; telephone, e-mail or IM interaction; or representations of family interaction in film, television, fiction, or theater. The class will examine discourse examples together in workshop format. Requirements. Each student will be responsible for finding, summarizing, and commenting on 10 outside readings, and for providing both a one-page written summary and a five-minute oral summary of each for class. Each student will conduct an independent research project which will provide the material for both a class presentation and a final paper. Final papers are expected to be of near-publishable quality. Attendance is required; no auditors, no incompletes, no late papers. Reading packet to be purchased.

  - :name: Generative Syntax I (Spanish 527)
    :number: "527"
    :description: After a brief introduction to the philosophy and methods of generative grammar, this course examines some of the basic aspects of modern syntactic theory. It starts with an in depth discussion of the need for postulating syntactic structures and then moves on to examine how best to account for phenomena such as word order variation, the distribution and referential properties of noun phrases, and differences among clausal types. These phenomena will be analyzed mainly through the insights offered by the Principles and Parameters framework. The course format consists of two general lectures, co-taught by the instructors, and one discussion session per week. The discussion sessions allow us to break up the class in four small groups, and guarantee that each student has ample opportunity to ask questions and pursue discussion topics in some depth. Two of the discussion sessions reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures and provide close guidance in problem solving; the other two provide the opportunity to explore theoretical concepts and empirical phenomena in greater depth. Each student chooses which discussion session to attend, and is free to change groups at any time during the course of the semester. LING/SPAN 527 is the first segment of a two-semester sequence that aims to familiarize the students with the Government and Binding theory (GB) and provide them the tools they need to read the primary literature in syntax. The second semester course, LING/SPAN 528, considerably expands the coverage of empirical phenomena and the discussion of theoretical issues, including the relation between GB and the Minimalist framework.

    :number: "533"
    :description: "Topic for Fall 2007: EVIDENTIALITY Many languages \xE2\x80\x93 including such diverse ones as Turkish, Tibetan, Quechua, Korean, Bulgarian, and Japanese \xE2\x80\x93 have grammaticalized means for expressing the speaker\xE2\x80\x99s SOURCE of information for what s/he is saying. For example, Cuzco Quechua has a typical system with three forms expressing that: (i) some idea is known by direct evidence, or (ii) believed due to inference, or (iii) passed along from another person\xE2\x80\x99s report. Many linguists have suggested that evidentiality is important in all languages \xE2\x80\x93 it is simply in hiding in languages where we\xE2\x80\x99re not used to looking for it, like English. Thus, for example, we have Chafe proposing that many elements which we usually categorize as modals in English express evidentiality in addition (or instead), and many contemporary semanticists arguing about whether epistemic modality and evidentiality are one and the same thing. One wave of work in evidentiality came ashore around 1986, culminating in a collection of papers with a descriptive/functional orientation edited by Chafe and Nichols. We are now in the midst of another. This one is focusing on the semantics, pragmatics, and syntax of evidentials and categories which are often closely related, like aspect and modality. This means that the seminar will be a good place for students to learn about language diversity while pursuing research in semantics, pragmatics, syntax, typology, or language description. A few weeks of the course will be taken up with a discussion of some recent fieldwork I\xE2\x80\x99ve been involved in. During my sabbatical during 2006-2007, I did research (together with colleagues) on the Austronesian language Tsou. Tsou has a poorly understood system of auxiliaries and affixes which express meanings somehow related to evidentiality, deixis, tense, and modality. To get a feel for the relations, think about the fact that an object which is far away and therefore not visible is intuitively like an event which is far away in time, in the future; and that neither of these things is known about through immediate perceptual experience, but rather through indirect means like inference or memory. We\xE2\x80\x99re not sure how to understand the semantics of Tsou yet, but I\xE2\x80\x99m eager to report on what we do know and think about it some more in the context of the seminar. Students can undertake the course with either the spirit of the field linguist (\xE2\x80\x9CLet\xE2\x80\x99s figure out this language!\xE2\x80\x9D) or the theoretical linguist (\xE2\x80\x9CWhat capacity of the human mind is responsible for the fact that people talk this way?) In practical terms, you can \xE2\x80\xA6 1) \xE2\x80\xA6 follow a descriptive orientation: Students may choose to make their semester project a descriptive study, for example by doing fieldwork on a language with evidentials. \xE2\x80\x93 or \xE2\x80\x93 2) \xE2\x80\xA6 or, follow a theoretical orientation. Students may choose to write a research paper focusing on the syntax, semantics, and/or pragmatics of evidentials. Students also have another choice to make. You can take the course as 533 or as 733. If you wish to do original fieldwork as a descriptive semester project or write a seminar-quality term paper, and thus get credit for the course as a seminar, take it as 733. If you only want to do readings and do a shorter, less original project, take it as 533. I recommend that students taking the course as 733 meet one of the following criteria: you\xE2\x80\x99ve taken Formal Semantics, you\xE2\x80\x99ve taken Syntax III, or you\xE2\x80\x99re at least a third year student and have a good knowledge of a language with evidentials."

R\xC3\xA9v\xC3\xA9sz: xxx in ICC xxx Course description This course provides a general introduction to theories and approaches in second language acquisition (SLA) and bilingualism. The first part of the course focuses on bilingualism; key topics include research and theory on the dimensions and assessment of bilingualism; the ontogenesis of bilingualism; bilinguality and cognitive development, as well as social, cultural, and educational perspectives on bilingualism. In the second part of the course, cognitive-interactionist, sociocultural, frequency-based, input-processing and psycholinguistic perspectives of SLA are discussed together with factors that influence the L2 learning process (including individual differences). The application of SLA theory to understanding L2 learners\xE2\x80\x99 interlanguage production will be explored, including work on classroom/instructed L2 learning. This course emphasizes the central role of both cognition and social interaction in language learning; UG approaches to child/first language acquisition are not covered in detail in this class. (Either Ling-553 or Ling-551 are required for students pursuing the MAT. Ling-553 can also serve as a prerequisite for some of the more advanced classes in SLA and/or bilingualism.) Course aims and objectives Aims: The aim of this course is to introduce participants to a range of contemporary approaches to research in second language acquisition (SLA) and bilingualism. Objectives: Participants will understand basic findings from theoretical and empirical research in second language acquisition and bilingualism. Participants will develop their critical thinking and writing skills by carrying out an inquiry-based empirical project related to an issue in SLA and/or bilingualism. Required Reading 1. Wei, L.

These components are weighted as follows: Homework assignments (2 x 15%) 20% Leading discussion of the readings 20% Final paper 25% Class participation 20% Final presentations 10% Grades at the A-level indicate a thorough and accurate understanding of all of the concepts and issues covered in the class lectures and course readings. Grades at the A-level display the ability to apply those concepts accurately and coherently when describing and interpreting L2 and bilingual data. A-level work also includes evidence of synthesis of information and insight that goes beyond summarization of the materials. Grades at the B-level indicate generally accurate understanding of the concepts and issues covered in the class lectures and readings. However, there may be some misunderstandings or gaps in knowledge. Grades at the B-level indicate the ability to apply concepts accurately and coherently when describing and interpreting L2 data, but the analysis may not be comprehensive or well-organized. B-level work represents the ability to summarize the arguments and issues presented through the course materials, but lacks independent analysis and synthesis."

    :description: "This course explores task-based approaches to second/foreign language learning and teaching using the following organizational principles: (a) the theoretical underpinnings for task-based language learning; (b) the key components of task-based program design; (c) cognitive-interactionist research frameworks for the evaluation of tasks as learning tools; (d) the process of developing and empirically testing task-based materials; (e) practical classroom considerations for the use/implementation of tasks in an instructional context. Students will participate in instructor- and student-led discussions, complete short homework assignments, explore and analyze existing task-based language programs, and carry out a final project on communicative tasks in either a classroom or experimental context. This course can be taken as a regular graduate class (LING-494) or as a graduate seminar (LING-558). The syllabus and meeting times will be the same for each class, but seminar participants will undertake a final project that is more substantial in scope. COURSE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Aims: The aim of this course is to introduce participants to issues, both practical and theoretical, surrounding task-based language learning and teaching. Objectives: Participants will gain an understanding of the issues at the core of task-based language teaching (TBLT) and, as a result, be able to contribute to the current discussion and practice in TBLT. In addition, participants will develop (a) their ability to engage in academic discussions by facilitating and participating in in-class discussions and (b) their critical thinking and writing skills by carrying out the class assignments. Seminar participants will show a greater understanding of, and ability to discuss, issues related to TBLT than participants taking the course as a regular graduate class."

    :description: "In this course, we will investigate how language shapes and is shaped by society. We will range over many levels of social organization (from nation to neighborhood to individual) as well as many levels of language organization (from phoneme to conversation to entire languages). We will also consider how sociolinguistic knowledge can be applied to areas such as language policy and planning (including issues pertaining to societal bi- and multilingualism and language death), languages and dialects in education (e.g. the use of Ebonics in the classroom), and language and the law (e.g. applying linguistic analysis to threatening communications to identify offenders/narrow suspect pools). Required Readings: Wardhaugh, Ronald. 2006. An introduction to sociolinguistics (Fifth edition). Malden/Oxford: Blackwell. An additional course reader, consisting of a series of articles, will also be required. This will be made available through electronic reserves during the first or second week of class. Format: Each week\xE2\x80\x99s classes will consist of a combination of lectures and student discussions/presentations. Each of you will make at least two presentations: (1) a presentation of your final research paper at the end of the semester, and (2) a presentation of an article or chapter we read in class. The latter presentation will consist of a brief summary of the article/chapter, followed by critique and class discussion, which you will lead. You may be asked to present on more than one article/chapter, depending on how many students are in the class. Presentations and research projects may be group or individual. Group projects will receive group grades. Requirements: Grades will be based on the following: Mid-semester paper: This paper (approx. 5-8 pp.) will be based largely on your reflections/observations on some matter pertaining to language and society; some suggested topics will be announced in class. The paper will count for 15% of your final grade. Final research paper: This paper (approx. 15 pp.) will be based on a sociolinguistic topic of your choice and counts for 30% of your final grade. Written summary/critique (approx. 5 pp.) of a sociolinguistic study not discussed in class: 15% of final grade.

    :description: "Over the past twenty years or so, scholars of language and social life have been investigating language use within clinical settings, most frequently focusing on interactions between physicians and their patients. For some of these scholars, such research sites offer intriguing real-life contexts in which their favorite discourse phenomena can be examined in situ; others are lured by a concrete place in which they can investigate the role of language in the relationship between ideology and practice; still others are attracted by an opportunity to work towards the solution of important societal problems such as those sometimes displayed in the talk between physicians and patients, physicians and nurses, health care counselors and their clients, etc. In this course, students will have the opportunity to build on their knowledge and practice of discourse analysis by investigating the talk that occurs within a range of clinical contexts. During the first few weeks of the course, students will read and discuss both classic and current readings in the field of discourse and medicine in order to become familiar with the wide range of language issues dealt with by researchers in this area. With that background, students will then design and carry out investigations of audio- or videotaped health care interactions. Students may work on interactions that they have taped themselves or choose to work on interactions taped as part of research and/or consulting projects with which the professor is associated, such as HEALING WORDS (physician-patient interactions centered on 30+ diseases or conditions, ranging from diabetes to hepatitis C to lung cancer), STORYTELLER (life stories told by patients and health care workers), GENETIC COUNSELING AS DISCOURSE (interactions between genetic counselors and their clients regarding hereditary health problems or chromosomal abnormalities), HOSPITALK (interdisciplinary discharge rounds involving a variety of health care professionals with background one-on-one interviews), and LANGUAGE and ALZHEIMER\xE2\x80\x99S DISEASE (conversations between researchers and individuals with Alzheimer\xE2\x80\x99s disease). Students who are interested in working as a linguistic consultant in the health care professions (or even in other professions, such as education or law) will find this seminar to be a solid introduction to the challenges of doing discourse analysis across disciplinary boundaries. Throughout the semester we will consider the influence of different disciplinary paradigms in all phases of our research projects -- including decisions about what research questions are thought to be both answerable and important or useful; what participants and settings can be included in a study; what kinds of language data can be collected and how; what types of theoretical frameworks and analytical units can be brought to the research; what counts as research findings; and, finally, how those findings should be reported and to whom."

    :description: "LINGUISTICS 587 DISCOURSE ANALYSIS: NARRATIVE Schiffrin OVERVIEW OF COURSE Narratives have been studied by many different disciplines: literary theory, clinical, cognitive and developmental psychology, folklore, anthropology, sociology and linguistics. The primary focus of this course is the sociolinguistic study of narrative through discourse analysis. Our initial attention is spontaneous oral narratives told during conversations or conversation-like interactions. However, we will also compare and contrast stories that are written and electronically communicated. Likewise, although our discussions and analyses will dwell primarily on narrative told by one person, in one place, and at one time, in everyday life, we will also touch on narratives that develop across time, places and persons. We begin by discussing basic features of discourse analysis and sociolinguistic frameworks for the study of narrative, while collecting and transcribing narratives for our own analyses. We then turn to how different parts of language (e.g. tense, referring terms, reported speech) are used to create a story world, and how that story world both constructs, and reflects, different facets of context (including identity, relationships and social interaction). Included will be discussion of very short stories, long life stories, public stories, retold performances of stories, intertextual stories, and the infiltration of the notion of \xE2\x80\x9Cnarrative\xE2\x80\x9D into therapy, medicine, politics, history, law and business. COURSE REQUIREMENTS -Data (1) Tape and transcribe one narrative (with at least 4 narrated \xE2\x80\x98events\xE2\x80\x99); include a few lines of its surrounding conversation (2) Ask for three more versions of the oral narratives, in which the person (a) tells the story again, (b) emails you the story and (b) writes the story. (3) We will combine all the narratives into a class corpus. -Complete readings (articles, book chapters). We will review and discuss readings in class: what do the readings tell us about the topic of interest? how do they continue (or alter) previous work? how can we use the ideas to analyze our narratives? Bring the readings to class on their assigned date. -Complete 4 exercises (2- 3 pp. each). Exercises require application of the readings to your data and/or to class data. Be prepared to discuss your exercises in class on the day on which they are due. After class discussion, you should post your exercises on Blackboard for a class archive. No late submissions accepted! -Final paper (8- 10 pages) that integrates issues raised in the readings with data analysis GRADING Grades are based on exercises, final paper, and contributions to class. Each exercise counts for 15% of your grade (total 60%), the final paper counts for 30%, and class contributions for the remaining 10%.

Email: revesz@exchange.tc.columbia.edu COURSE AIMS: The course covers both quantitative and qualitative applied linguistics research methods, including identifying research problems and questions; selecting elicitation measures; collecting second and foreign language data; dealing with ethical issues related to data gathering; validity and reliability in research; research in second and foreign language classroom contexts; data description and coding; and data analysis and presenting (powerpoints and posters) and writing up SLA research. In-class discussions and data-based skill-building exercises promote understanding of the principles. As the essential components of a range of different methods are grasped, students prepare a detailed research design for an applied linguistics study, including piloting some aspects of the design with a view to improving the final version. Class participants are likely to be at different stages in their graduate study, and the course (and assessment) aims to accommodate differing goals. Where possible, participants are encouraged to select a method of research not yet attempted. Both small-scale replication studies and original work are encouraged. More advanced students who intend to use a particular methodology for their doctoral research may design and carry out a pilot study, if sufficiently prepared to do so. COURSE COMPONENTS: Preparation and Participation: Since this is a practical methods class, participation is mandatory. Preparation for participation includes reading chapters and research articles and reviewing materials in advance of class and being able to discuss the materials. Preparation for presentation/critique of the methods used in published research studies varies from student to student, but generally includes preparing some sort of notebook/database which facilitates easy recall of the details of an empirical investigation, as well as the major theoretical motivations and arguments of the researchers. Participation involves discussion of problems and critiquing of classmates\xE2\x80\x99 proposed designs as well as raising questions for general class discussion. Research design problems/case studies will be presented regularly for in-class small group work. Designing a Study: Class participants are likely to be at different stages in their graduate study, and the course (and assessment) aims to accommodate differing goals. Where possible, participants are encouraged to select a method of research not yet attempted. Both small-scale replication studies and original work are encouraged. More advanced students who intend to use a particular methodology for their doctoral research may design and carry out a pilot study, if sufficiently prepared to do so. Students are encouraged to take the initiative in molding their research designs to fit their future research needs.

  - :name: Phonological Theory in Second Language Phonology
    :number: "713"
    :description: "How do speakers use pitch changes to encode lexical and phrasal contrasts? What kind of representation should linguists use to talk about it? Linguists look at tone and intonation from many different angles: \xE2\x80\xA2 Sociolinguists may want to discuss intonational meaning in discourse contexts. \xE2\x80\xA2 Applied linguists may want to study how to help language learners in the difficult task of producing natural intonation contours. \xE2\x80\xA2 Computational linguists may want to improve the generation or recognition of intonation in computer-generated speech. \xE2\x80\xA2 Phonologists may be interested in how the representation of pitch contrasts and rules can be integrated into phonological theory. \xE2\x80\xA2 Syntacticians and sematicists may want to study the way intonation can change syntactic and lexical meanings. The goal of this class is bring together linguists representing all of these different viewpoints, to investigate the data, to read current relevant articles, and to work toward a common vocabulary for further research. Topics to be covered (especially the balance between tone and intonation) will depend in part on the interests of the participants, but major areas of interest should include: I. Phonetics of tone and intonation. How are pitch contrasts made? How can we measure them? II. The data. What are the possible patterns of lexical pitch contrast? What are the possible tonal rules? How should they be represented? What are the possible patterns of phrasal pitch contrast? How do languages differ in the use of intonation? How should intonational contrasts be represented? III. Intonational meaning. How do patterns of intonation get used? IV. Interactions. Do tone and intonation interact? How can we represent the interaction? Requirements: reading, class participation, class presentations, final paper. Ling 713. Seminar on Tone and Intonation.

    :number: "723"
    :description: This seminar is designed to provide training in advanced discourse analysis in the interactional sociolinguistic mode, using family interaction as a research site. Anthropologist Lila Abu-Lughod notes that "The family ... is the prototype of hierarchical relationships." It is also the prototype of close relationships--as well as of gender relations. Thus the focus on family interaction provides occasion for delving into the theoretical frameworks of power and solidarity as well as gender and language. We will also examine other current theoretical frameworks such as intertextuality and identity. Readings will include classic and current theoretical and methodological work and also review the existing literature on family interaction in linguistics and related disciplines. In addition, we will consider the effects of technological advances such as cellphones, email and IM on interpersonal interaction and hence relationships. Seminar members will collect and analyze discourse data, which could take the form of audiotaped or videotaped face to face interaction; telephone, e-mail or IM interaction; or representations of family interaction in film, television, fiction, or theater. The class will examine discourse examples together in workshop format. Requirements. Each student will be responsible for finding, summarizing, and commenting on 10 outside readings, and for providing both a one-page written summary and a five-minute oral summary of each for class. Each student will conduct an independent research project which will provide the material for both a class presentation and a final paper. Final papers are expected to be of near-publishable quality. Attendance is required; no auditors, no incompletes, no late papers. Reading packet to be purchased.

  - :name: Seminar in Semantics
    :number: "733"
    :description: "Topic for Fall 2007: EVIDENTIALITY Many languages \xE2\x80\x93 including such diverse ones as Turkish, Tibetan, Quechua, Korean, Bulgarian, and Japanese \xE2\x80\x93 have grammaticalized means for expressing the speaker\xE2\x80\x99s SOURCE of information for what s/he is saying. For example, Cuzco Quechua has a typical system with three forms expressing that: (i) some idea is known by direct evidence, or (ii) believed due to inference, or (iii) passed along from another person\xE2\x80\x99s report. Many linguists have suggested that evidentiality is important in all languages \xE2\x80\x93 it is simply in hiding in languages where we\xE2\x80\x99re not used to looking for it, like English. Thus, for example, we have Chafe proposing that many elements which we usually categorize as modals in English express evidentiality in addition (or instead), and many contemporary semanticists arguing about whether epistemic modality and evidentiality are one and the same thing. One wave of work in evidentiality came ashore around 1986, culminating in a collection of papers with a descriptive/functional orientation edited by Chafe and Nichols. We are now in the midst of another. This one is focusing on the semantics, pragmatics, and syntax of evidentials and categories which are often closely related, like aspect and modality. This means that the seminar will be a good place for students to learn about language diversity while pursuing research in semantics, pragmatics, syntax, typology, or language description. A few weeks of the course will be taken up with a discussion of some recent fieldwork I\xE2\x80\x99ve been involved in. During my sabbatical during 2006-2007, I did research (together with colleagues) on the Austronesian language Tsou. Tsou has a poorly understood system of auxiliaries and affixes which express meanings somehow related to evidentiality, deixis, tense, and modality. To get a feel for the relations, think about the fact that an object which is far away and therefore not visible is intuitively like an event which is far away in time, in the future; and that neither of these things is known about through immediate perceptual experience, but rather through indirect means like inference or memory. We\xE2\x80\x99re not sure how to understand the semantics of Tsou yet, but I\xE2\x80\x99m eager to report on what we do know and think about it some more in the context of the seminar. Students can undertake the course with either the spirit of the field linguist (\xE2\x80\x9CLet\xE2\x80\x99s figure out this language!\xE2\x80\x9D) or the theoretical linguist (\xE2\x80\x9CWhat capacity of the human mind is responsible for the fact that people talk this way?) In practical terms, you can \xE2\x80\xA6 1) \xE2\x80\xA6 follow a descriptive orientation: Students may choose to make their semester project a descriptive study, for example by doing fieldwork on a language with evidentials. \xE2\x80\x93 or \xE2\x80\x93 2) \xE2\x80\xA6 or, follow a theoretical orientation. Students may choose to write a research paper focusing on the syntax, semantics, and/or pragmatics of evidentials. Students also have another choice to make. You can take the course as 533 or as 733. If you wish to do original fieldwork as a descriptive semester project or write a seminar-quality term paper, and thus get credit for the course as a seminar, take it as 733. If you only want to do readings and do a shorter, less original project, take it as 533. I recommend that students taking the course as 733 meet one of the following criteria: you\xE2\x80\x99ve taken Formal Semantics, you\xE2\x80\x99ve taken Syntax III, or you\xE2\x80\x99re at least a third year student and have a good knowledge of a language with evidentials."

    :description: "This course explores task-based approaches to second/foreign language learning and teaching using the following organizational principles: (a) the theoretical underpinnings for task-based language learning; (b) the key components of task-based program design; (c) cognitive-interactionist research frameworks for the evaluation of tasks as learning tools; (d) the process of developing and empirically testing task-based materials; (e) practical classroom considerations for the use/implementation of tasks in an instructional context. Students will participate in instructor- and student-led discussions, complete short homework assignments, explore and analyze existing task-based language programs, and carry out a final project on communicative tasks in either a classroom or experimental context. This course can be taken as a regular graduate class (LING-494) or as a graduate seminar (LING-558). The syllabus and meeting times will be the same for each class, but seminar participants will undertake a final project that is more substantial in scope. COURSE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES Aims: The aim of this course is to introduce participants to issues, both practical and theoretical, surrounding task-based language learning and teaching. Objectives: Participants will gain an understanding of the issues at the core of task-based language teaching (TBLT) and, as a result, be able to contribute to the current discussion and practice in TBLT. In addition, participants will develop (a) their ability to engage in academic discussions by facilitating and participating in in-class discussions and (b) their critical thinking and writing skills by carrying out the class assignments. Seminar participants will show a greater understanding of, and ability to discuss, issues related to TBLT than participants taking the course as a regular graduate class."

    :number: "392"
    :description: "This course introduces major issues and relevant theories in the acquisition of Japanese in order to obtain a better understanding of first and second language acquisition processes. Issues are selected on the basis on the following questions: (a) What are major differences between acquiring Japanese as a first language and a second/foreign language? (b) How does knowledge of a first language influence learning of Japanese? (c) Are there any aspects that differentiate the acquisition of Japanese from that of other languages? If so, what are they?, and (d) How is Japanese taught as a second/foreign language in classroom settings and what effects does instruction have? The course discusses the traditional and current theories of language acquisition and critically examines recent studies on the acquisition of Japanese to determine the validity of the theories. Students are expected to obtain insights into the issues in Japanese acquisition research, formulate research questions, and possibly design and conduct a study. Rigorous participation in class discussion, oral report, written assignments, data collection and analysis, and term project/paper are required. Conducted in English. This course satisfies one semester of the College's social science general education requirement."

  - :name: Instructed Second Language Acquisition
    :number: "509"
    :description: This graduate course is designed to introduce applied linguistics students to two major areas in the second language acquisition (SLA) research literature, namely, instructed SLA and research methodology. Instructed SLA can be defined as empirical efforts to investigate the potential effects of exposure to or instruction of targeted linguistic items in the input on learners? Second/foreign language (L2) development. This area of research subsumes several strands of empirical classroom-based studies that include focus on form, processing instruction, interaction, implicit vs. explicit learning conditions, classroom-based tasks, input/textual enhancement, and attention to form and meaning. Other key issues in this course on classroom language acquisition will include current theoretical models and hypotheses that provide the theoretical underpinnings of most instructed SLA studies, aptitude and learning styles, the nature of interlanguage, and other cognitive accounts of SLA. Students will conduct a replication data-based study with a special emphasis on improving the research designs of previous research.

    :description: "Phonetics studies the expressions of language, physiological , physical and perceptual. In this course, it will not be assumed that everyone has had some exposure to linguistics. The basic terms and concepts of linguistics will become familiar, and most of them will be re-encountered and reviewed during this course. The emphasis in Phonetics will be on the systematic description of the sounds and processes of speech production, transmission, and perception. This course is a linguist's approach to the study of speech sounds. By way of summary of the course: l. Introduction to speech as communication. --. human communication: sender, channel, receiver --. the place of Phonetics within language and in the processes of communication. 2. Articulation of Speech: specification of speech segments in terms of their articulatory descriptions: Chapters 1 &2 & 3 in the textbook. a. Vocalic segments b. Consonantal segments c. Suprasegmentals d. Syllables e. Speech processes e. Feature representation In the processes of description, the overall phonetic inventory of speech sounds that are used in the languages of the world will be covered, and in the process English phonetics will be encountered in a general way. In addition to their descriptions, sounds will be illustrated from a wide variety of languages of the world. If no native samples are available, then recorded samples will be played and listened to. E.g. examples from Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Spanish, Zulu, etc. the languages that the students in the class who are proficient in, or are currently studying, will be able to provide as much as possible in order to make phonetics relevant to the study of these specific languages. 3. Physiology of Speech: A serious exposition of the anatomical- physiological-neural bases of the speech mechanism. Chapter 6 in the textbook. a. The speech cavities b. The structure of the larynx c. The pharyngeal structures d. The nasal cavity e. The oral cavity: the tongue --the complex muscular structures- palate and teeth f. The oral opening, the lips and the surrounding muscular structures g. The vowel producing mechanisms h. The consonant producing mechanisms 4. Acoustics of Speech: A basic exposition of the acoustics of vowels, consonants and suprasegmentals of speech transmission. Chapter 7 in the textbook. a. The nature of sound b. The propagation and transmission of sound c. Types of sounds: harmonic and non-harmonic d. Simple and complex sound waves e. Properties of sound waves f. Acoustic characterization of vocalic sounds g. Acoustic characterization of consonantal sounds h. Acoustic theory of sound production I. Source and filter theory j. Sonagrams 5.Perception of Speech: a basic exposition to the perception and the auditory aspects of speech reception. Ch.8 a. Nature of sound perception b. Human ear c. Perception of vowels d. Perception of consonants e. Perception of prosodic elements f. Theories of speech perception 6. Transcription of speech sounds: We will be using the IPA set of symbols. A concurrent activity with the lectures will be the practice of transcribing the spoken form of language with proper differentiations for the varieties of the spoken forms. Class: The class format is that of a lecture, discussion and transcription. Participation is important, as phonetics is the most practical aspect of linguistics. The phonetics of segments, syllables, phrases and sentences are all individual. What a phonetician does is to approximate the transcriptions to reflect what is common and distinctive to each segment, syllable, phrase or sentence. The phonetic transcription, which is an approximation, becomes the point of reference to the speech of individual speakers of that speech community. One can represent individual or dialectal differences by this method of transcription if sufficient detail is tolerated. Phonetic Project: A phonetic description of a language will be the project for the semester. The description will be based on data from a native speaker. A presentation of the results will be made at the end of the semester to be followed by a written report. Textbook: Clark, John et al. 3rd ed. 2006. AN INTRODUCTION TO PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY.

New York: Cambridge University Press. Exams: There is no magic number on the number of exams. We will have about four/five. The approach will be topical, in the sense that when a topic has been sufficiently covered that would be the appropriate time to have an exam on it. e.g. vowels, consonants, syllables, etc. Most of the exams will be take home exams. Homework: transcriptions are an important part of phonetics, so transcription exercises or practices are apt topics, among others, for phonetic homework. Also take-home exam may constitute the homework for that week-end. Semester project: As the semester moves along, each student should be able to sketch the sound system of her/his language and be able to provide a sketch of the dialect. A sketch of some other speaker\xE2\x80\x99s dialect is the other alternative. Grading: Will take into account the exams, homework and class participation. Study: It has been found beneficial to study in groups. Linguists are language people, and language is for communication. Studying in a group is communicating about language by using language. There are no other contexts to discuss linguistics or phonetics except with other linguists or phoneticians. This makes it a necessity that one, somehow, communicate with one's colleagues/classmates. A small group of about three is a good vehicle for that. Food- beverage-Smoking consumption is not permitted during the class. Preparation for Phonetics and Linguistics : Communication: Apart from class gathering, office visits, etc, the use of e-mail or internet is another way to keep in contact with the teacher/TA/each other. There may be other means of electronic communication. Web, Blackboard and e-mail: We will be making use of some of the material on the Web. Also, most of the material covered in class, assignment, etc. we will put on Blackboard."

    :description: In this introduction to syntactic theory we examine the (mostly unconscious) knowledge that each native speaker has of the structure of his or her language. We work towards a model of such knowledge by analyzing several syntactic structures of English and other languages, focusing on such aspects of syntax as noun phrase structure, finite and non-finite clauses, and question formation. We adopt and refine a formal model of the grammar of languages following the tradition of Generative Grammar, a fruitful line of research that has been the mainstay of much (though not all) work in syntax since the 1950s. The course focuses on enabling students to acquire the methodology and the tools employed by researchers in linguistic theory.

Text and to a lesser extent speech are crucial encoding formats for the information revolution. In this course, you will be given insight into the fundamentals of how computers are used to represent, process and organize textual and spoken information, as well as tips on how to effectively integrate this knowledge into working practice. We will cover the theory and practice of human language technology. Topics include text encoding, search technology, tools for writing support, machine translation, dialogue systems, computer-aided language learning, and the social context of language technology.

We begin with an exploration of the history and distinctiveness of American English, including the language histories of the principal ethnic and racialized groups in the U.S., specifically African American English and Chicano English. We proceed by exploring other languages spoken in this country including Spanish, American Sign Language, Asian American and Native American languages and how these are implicated in questions of education, bilingualism, acquisition, and the English Only Movement. Important themes will include the implications of linguistic discrimination for the survival of minority languages and cultures, the educational success of children, equity in the workplace, and inter-racial/ethnic conflict.

Description of the Journal: The journal is meant to help your organize and synthesize your thoughts from readings and discussions as the semester progresses. Your entries should reflect an integration of ideas and perspectives of your classmates, a discussion of how topics raised connect to issues and ideas previously discussed, and an application of what you have learned to your own experiences, to current issues or historical events. THESE SHOULD NOT SIMPLY BE A SUMMARY OF READINGS OR DISCUSSIONS. Each journal entry should be approximately 3 pages long (typed, double-spaced) and should show to me that you are actively thinking of ways in which the sections of the course interact with one another. You may draw from your background, your own experiences, your studies, work, observations, conversations that you have had, things that your encounter in the news. As you begin to identify a final project idea you may use the journal to discuss issues surrounding that process. You should also feel free to include questions or problems that you are having with the material, lingering concerns or difficulties. I will be looking at these holistically and evaluating them based on the development of your thinking over the course of the semester. Presentation / Participation: This course is highly interactive and discussion-centered. You must come to class prepared to discuss the readings and we will be developing skills of both leading and participating in discussions. Discussion Leaders To facilitate this transition, and to prepare you for your final presentations, you will each be assigned to be a Discussion Leader for a specific class. You will be expected to lead the class for approximately 10 minutes on the given topic, sharing an application of the readings or an activity (drawing from your personal experiences, from an article in the news or an academic article) and then eliciting discussion from your classmates. For each day there will be approximately 4 discussion leaders, and although you do not have to work together, I highly encourage you to do so for the sake of developing your ideas and for making the discussions as engaging and stimulating as they can be. Final Presentations The last few class meetings you will be presenting to the class the results of your final project. For all presentations, I encourage you to be creative and to use any media that you find useful to draw from. Please let me know in advance of any AV requirements you may have. Midterm Exam: Will be take-home and short essay. There is no final exam. THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP EXAM - PLESE HAND IN EXAM THE DAY THAT IT IS DUE. Final Project: May be done as an individual or as a group project. If you do hand in a paper, the length of the final write-up should be roughly 10 pages per person (double spaced, 12pt font) However, the project need not be a paper. It can be a website or a film, it can be a portfolio, or a workshop, or even a play (etc.). I encourage you to draw from your personal skills and interests and to be creative. Georgetown has an excellent media facility in the library that can provide you with cameras, software, and training if you start early enough! For a list of what Gelardin has available: http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/gelardin/ Please let me know in advance how you are planning to undertake this project. Honor System: You are all familiar with the honor system here at Georgetown University. Violations of the honor system may include any of the following: cheating on exams and other assignments, committing plagiarism, using false citations, submitting work for multiple purposes, submitting false data, falsifying academic documentation, abuse of library privileges, and abuse of shared electronic media."

Students learn skills for developing and analyzing materials in accordance with knowledge about how second languages are learned and taught. Practical classroom input issues and linguistic and pedagogical rationales for the materials and methods are key considerations. The course utilizes a practical, hands-on approach to adapting current materials and developing new materials. The focus is on materials for the different skills in current use in communicative methods in today\xC2\xB9s classrooms, including task- based approaches to language teaching, computer-assisted language learning, and content-based instruction. Concepts such as learning styles, different teaching contexts (including child/adolescent learners, ESL vs. EFL, etc.), culture, authenticity and classroom management are also discussed in this class.

In other words, it will provide ways to learn about various tools to at least partially automate or accelerate linguistic analysis. We cannot replace linguistic intuition, but we provide students with a greater understanding of how and when to use empirical approaches to linguistic analysis. A large emphasis of the course is in how to deal with large amounts of language data and to understand practical issues in dealing with corpora, annotation and multi-lingual data.

    :description: "Traditional views of language and the mind hold that language and thought are inherently literal and that metaphor is a special human ability, belonging to the area of literature and requiring different cognitive and linguistic skills than those employed in ordinary language. In this course we will examine an alternative view--conceptual metaphor theory. Conceptual metaphor theory argues that metaphor is a fundamental aspect of how humans understand and think about the world. This understanding, or cognitive representation, of the world is in turn reflected in everyday language. We will examine many examples of metaphor in everyday language taken from sources such as newspapers, sports commentary, and political speeches. We will also consider research from psychology, experimental psycholinguistics, child language acquisition, and anthropology that challenges the traditional view and establishes important links between everyday metaphor and cognitive structure.

    :description: "Politics is intimately related to persuasion and manipulation. Thus, the mastery of language is highly integrated with political life. The quantity and variety of spoken and written political texts, the wealth of genres and rhetorical styles, and the intensity of the political word offer rich arenas for the study of language. We will approach this task from both communication and linguistic perspectives while examining campaign communication, political speeches, advertising, debates, and media coverage. The linguistic focus will highlight discursive practices of argumentation and persuasion, as well as the use of metaphor, framing, and politeness. We will also consider the changing landscape of global political language after September 11. Different approaches to the language of politics \xE2\x80\x93 from communication theories to cognitive and pragmatic methods \xE2\x80\x93 will help us shed light on the Aristotelian claim that we are all political animals, able to use language to pursue our own ends. This course is appropriate for students in communication and linguistics, as well as political scientists and those interested in political careers. While basic knowledge of linguistics will be helpful, the assignments will be adjusted to the student\xE2\x80\x99s background and field of study. Texts & Readings Chilton, Paul A.

  - :name: Syntax and Variation
    :number: "386"
    :description: "Two ways to study the language phenomenon start at opposite ends of language. Theories of formal syntax try to discover the principles that determine possible structures that are available. The emphasis has been on the invariant principles (including the kind of alternative principles called \xE2\x80\x9Cparameters\xE2\x80\x9D) that distinguish what can be a syntactic structure from what cannot be. In the other approach, variation analysis, variation among alternative ways of saying the same thing is central. In this tradition, regularity, order and pattern have been found in the variation in observed language behavior in communities of speakers. So formal syntax is interested in what the structures available in languages are like, while largely ignoring how people actually use them when talking to each other. Variation analysis is very interested in what speakers use what constructions under what circumstances, and has very little to say about where these constructions come from and what their characteristics are. Each kind of research has been successful in discovering previously unknown regularities. Each tends to be dismissive of the results of the other kind of research. This course will examine the ways in which insights from these two approaches can both be included in our understanding of language. If variation in syntax and the formal properties of syntactic structures are part of the same theory, then we should try to develop a blend of the two approaches, or a third approach that predicts the regularities revealed by both. On the other hand, they may be supplemental theories, both of which contribute to a holistic understanding of language, but are fundamentally separate so that no unification of the two is possible. If there is a single theory of syntax, then the variation discovered in language variation studies is inherent, and syntactic theory should be probabilistic and not deterministic, as is usually assumed. If this is the case, we have to ask how the present deterministic theory can be modified so that it is probabilistic without giving up the insights that have been gleaned from over a half-century of generative syntax research. If we have supplementary and complementary theories\xE2\x80\x94one about invariant structures and the other about observed variation, then we want to know how they work together to give a complete picture of the language phenomenon. Methodological considerations arise as well. Variation studies depend on observed speech data, which are always variable. Formal syntax depends largely on \xE2\x80\x9Cacceptability judgments\xE2\x80\x9D, meaning the researcher constructs sentences that her theory predicts should or should not be possible and then asks a speaker of the language, usually herself, whether the result is \xE2\x80\x9Cgood\xE2\x80\x9D or not. These judgments are generally taken to be yes/no judgments. Variation research uses the frequencies with which alternate forms turn up in speech data as the basis for the regularities that it finds. We will examine the ideologies that lead to these contrasting methods. We will go one step further and introduce mathematical methods that are something like the frequency studies of variation analysis to examine cases of acceptability judgments that are intermediate between yes and no. This course will has a fundamentally lecture-discussion form, but it will be supplemented by Powerpoint. Students grades will be determined 40% by an out-of-class exercise, and 60% by a short (5 to 10 pages) paper presenting your opinion on the relationship between the two approaches. As prerequisites, students should have a basic familiarity with the Minimalist Program approach to syntax. Syntax (LING 225) or Generative Syntax I (LING 527, SPANISH 527) or the equivalent provide this background. Familiarity with variation analysis would be helpful, but not essential.

Topics covered include the language of police and suspects (e.g. the language of \xE2\x80\x98consensual\xE2\x80\x99 searches, interrogations, confessions, advising of/requesting right to counsel); language crimes (e.g. solicitation, conspiracy, bribery, threats, perjury, plagiarism); and linguistics as evidence (e.g. identifying anonymous authors of documents associated with criminal activity, identifying anonymous voices). We will also discus the status of linguistic evidence in court and how best to disseminate relevant knowledge about linguistics to law enforcement practitioners, judges, lawyers, juries, etc. The course will incorporate lecture, class discussion, demonstrations and exercises pertaining to language crimes and linguistic evidence, presentations by practitioners in the field, and student presentations. Students will also complete a series of written assignments and a semester research project (possibly based on an unsolved crime involving linguistic analysis).

This course will introduce you to the fundamentals of statistical NLP. Statistical NLP builds on ideas from many fields, including linguistics, probability theory, information theory, programming, and computer science. We will see how these fields provide us with tools to engage in part-of-speech (POS) tagging, parsing, word sense disambiguation, machine translation, and information retrieval. The focus of the course is very data-driven, meaning that students will be working with large corpora and will be learning how to handle such large pieces of data. Applying statistical techniques to large corpora will also allow us to examine collocations and n-grams, along with techniques for categorizing text.

  - :name: Ethnography of Poetry
    :number: "432"
    :description: The enjoyment of poetry is a continuous process. An understanding of the ethnographic framework which has served the poet is essential to its appreciation and for the comprehension of its concealed meanings. This understanding includes the awareness of beliefs, norms, myths, and figures of speech specific to the cultural experiences behind poetry. Even similes and metaphors drawn exclusively from sensory experiences need some kind of ethnographic clarification. Thus, with the belief that poetry springs from the specific impulses of place and time, and that its roots are deeply embedded in the experiences of poets, in this course we propose to study at least 50 poems and their ethnographies representing major cultures of the world. Poets are in some ways far in advance of the point of view of their own time, and yet very much of it, very largely partake of its limited merits, faults, and fashions. Poets are universal, and at the same time confined by the particulars of their cultures, which they themselves do not create. Poets are men with restless, critical, curious minds and the sense of the age. They often have great strength to suffer. Since they cannot escape suffering and cannot transcend it, so they attract pain to themselves. But what they could, with that immense passive strength and sensibilities which no pain could impair, is to study suffering. Often much more that is perishable enters the work of a poet. To say this is only to say that a poet belongs to a definite place in time.

In addition to learning about the origins of each approach (what data or problems motivated the approach?), current theories (how are explanations constructed?) and a range of methods (what's counting, coding, interpreting?) we will test out each approach to see what kinds of solutions it can offer for the study of some of the key issues in this field: how do we refer to things? how do we tell stories? how do we organize conversation? how do we ask and answer questions? how we we get people to do other things for us? how do we use language to construct our identities? Course format includes some lecture, but focuses primarily on discussion and application of approaches to data (some provided by instructor, some collected by students).

    :description: "The purpose of this course is to introduce students to theories and methods of discourse analysis. This is a companion course, not a sequel, to Discourse Analysis: Narrative. Whereas Discourse Analysis: Narrative is concerned with discourse produced primarily by one speaker, Discourse Analysis: Conversation is concerned with dialogic or multi-party discourse. This course is a combination lecture/workshop. The theoretical focus is anthropological and interactional sociolinguistics, although students will be introduced to ethnomethodological approaches as well. Topics include transcription theory and practice, turn-taking, adjacency pairs, repair, framing/footing, identity construction/positioning, politeness theory, conversational style, repetition, discourse markers, and conversations within institutional contexts. In order to provide a coherent body of data for analysis throughout the semester, each student will tape record one naturally-occurring casual conversation in which he or she is a participant. Students will transcribe 3-5 minute segments of each interaction. These short segments of conversation will provide data for class discussion and periodic written assignments in which students apply the analytic methods and theories presented in course readings.

  - :name: Cognitive and Functional Approaches to Language
    :number: "485"
    :description: "This course will be useful to any student interested in learning to think about linguistic structure in ways that relate meaning and context to linguistic form. The question of the relationship between linguistic form (syntax) and meaning (word meaning, semantics and pragmatics) has been one which every approach to linguistics has grappled. Contemporary theories of language offer a range of perspectives on these issues. Traditional approaches emphasize the autonomy of syntax and the analysis of decontextualized sentence structure. In this course, we will focus on the analysis of grammatical constructions from a contextualized, usage-based perspective. A range of models fall under the general category of usage-based approaches to linguistic structure. For instance, the work of cognitive linguists (e.g. Goldberg, Langacker), as well as that of functional typologists (e.g. Givon, Hopper), all represent usage-based perspectives. Through the detailed analysis of linguistic data, this course will introduce you to the core ideas, methods of analysis, and insights into language that are shared by cognitive and functional models. Core concepts that will be highlighted include: -Language structure cannot be adequately understood or described in isolation from its context of use. There is a central interaction between syntax, meaning, and discourse such that no strict boundaries between syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and discourse exist. -The communicative functions served by language crucially influence the structures that occur in language. No two structures are completely synonymous. People choose between \xE2\x80\x9Ccompeting\xE2\x80\x9D structures, for instance between active and passive, in order to accomplish particular communicative goals. -The kinds of brains and the kinds of bodies human have, i.e. basic human biology, have important effects on the nature of language. Because humans all share the same basic neurological and physical architecture, languages will share universal or near universal properties. At least part of the structure of language is constrained by, and thus explained by, aspects of human cognitive processing. REQUIREMENTS: Analyses of grammatical constructions on a weekly basis Participation in class discussion Mid-term and Final Exams This course meets the syntax requirement for MAT students."

In everyday terms, Pragmatics addresses questions such as the following: How can we say more than we mean? How can we mean more than we say? Why and how do we say 'the same thing' in different ways? Why and how can we say 'different things' in the same way? Are all messages 'created equal?' Although Pragmatics often complements Formal Semantics, it is also a lively area of study within Sociolinguistics and Discourse Analysis: the latter approaches are the emphasis in the current course. Topics include speech acts such as apologies, assertions, threats and requests; politeness; power and solidarity; time, space and person markers; speaking and writing; organizing given and new information.We will also examine the wide applicability of pragmatic concepts and analyses in the language classroom, in analyzing cross cultural communication, and in \xE2\x80\x9Cdeconstructing\xE2\x80\x9D language in everyday life (including the workplace).

    :description: "This course is designed as a one-semester introduction to the basics of phonetics and phonology, that is, to the linguistic analysis of the sound patterns of the languages of the world. It is divided into four sections: 1. Articulatory phonetics (how speech sounds are made) 2. Acoustic phonetics (how sound travels and how sound is measured) 3. Segmental phonology (how sounds contrast and alternate) 4. Suprasegmental phonology (how sounds are grouped into hierarchical constituents) Students will complete daily homework assignments to reinforce concepts and skills, and will complete four short projects (one for each section of the course). At the end of the class, students will have learned the terms and concepts central to phonology and phonetics, and will have acquired basic data analysis skills (including IPA transcription, techniques of acoustic analysis, and approaches to solving phonology problems), and will be prepared to move on to more advanced courses. No prerequisites."

  - :name: Formal Semantics
    :number: "532"
    :description: "Formal Semantics is intended to help students develop their skills in semantic analysis from the level achieved in Semantics and Pragmatics (LING 531) to a point where they can actively read current literature in the field. We do this by studying closely one or two topics each year, beginning with a lecture format, going over necessary background, and then moving on to a more seminar\xE2\x80\x93like atmosphere. Prerequisite: Semantics & Pragmatics or permission of instructor. The topic for Spring 2006 is modality and mood. \"Modality\" refers to aspects of language which allow us to speak about situations which are not real: for example, words like \"should\" or \"possible\". \"Mood\" refers to a paradigm of verb forms, especially those labeled \"indicative\" and \"subjunctive\", whose meaning often depends on the type of modality expressed in the sentence. Other topics closely related to modality and mood, and which we may discuss, include evidentiality and conditionals."

  - :name: Lexical Semantics
    :number: "535"
    :description: Lexical semantics is the study of how the meanings of words determine their morphosyntactic properties. Much work in lexical semantics focuses on deconstructing word meaning into more basic subcomponents and exploring how these basic subcomponents are encoded in the grammars of languages and how they determine morphosyntactic variation both within and across languages. In this course we read recent and classic literature in the semantic underpinnings of grammar, looking at semantic primitives such as causation, change-of-state, possession, and telicity, focusing primarily on how these semantic properties are implicated in the morphosyntactic behavior of verbs. We examine some particular proposals for incorporating lexical meaning into morphosyntactic behavior, including thematic roles, lexical-cognitive structures, and recent work on semantic decompositions in syntactic structure. We also touch upon the "other side" of lexical semantics, namely how lexical semantics may in turn be determined by or even determine aspects of cognition (e.g. the well known Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis). This course will be of interest to syntax students interested in the semantic underpinnings of syntax, semantics students interested in the subcomponents of word meaning, and students more broadly interested in the role of word meaning in language. The course will require a final paper, and students will be expected to present some of the readings in class.

    :number: "551"
    :description: "Note: This course has recently been renumbered from LING-351 to LING-551. Course description and objectives: This is an introductory graduate-credit course focusing on some of the central aspects of both first and second language acquisition. (Since I am equally interested in both, they will both be covered, but L2 acquisition is covered primarily in comparison with L1 acquisition.) Among the topics to be discussed are some of the ideas about language learning and the nature of language representation, proposed by psychologists and linguists such as Skinner, Piaget and Chomsky, and how these ideas continue to influence current approaches to language acquisition; at what point children are thought to know certain things about the language they\xE2\x80\x99re acquiring (and how we think we know this); how children learn to segment the speech stream (and why this may be much harder for adult language learners); the use of special kinds of input modification (such as \xE2\x80\x98motherese\xE2\x80\x99) and whether/how this is helpful or necessary for language development; how children\xE2\x80\x99s grammatical, lexical-semantic, and phonological systems develop, and how the highly developed native-language systems of adults influence their acquisition of a second language; the extent to which L1 and L2 acquisition are similar or \xE2\x80\x98fundamentally different\xE2\x80\x99; the critical period hypothesis and the case of Genie, with implications for adult L2 acquisition and L1 acquisition by Deaf children; and possibly other topics (as time and interest allow) such as L1 attrition, specific language impairment, and/or the role of motivation in language learning. Among the course objectives are the development of your critical thinking skills in the guided evaluation of some readings from the primary literature, and gaining some familiarity with the sort of experimental studies carried out in the field of language acquisition. Please note: although there may be some brief discussion of how certain ideas about language learning have been applied to language instruction (e.g., the audiolingual method as an application of behaviorist learning theory), this is not a course about classroom language learning or pedagogy. Prerequisite: LING-001 (Intro. to Language) or LING-401 (General Linguistics) or the equivalent. This is a firm prerequisite if you have not yet taken any other courses in formal linguistics. Course requirements: (1) Weekly preparation of readings and participation in class discussions of these readings; (2) Occasional short essays (approx. 4 or 5 of these over the course of the semester) answering one or more questions related to the reading; (3) One critical review essay of a primary literature article; (4) A final literature review paper organized around a research question of your choice.

  - :name: Applying Cognitive Linguistics
    :number: "552"
    :description: "The question of the complex relationship between language, experience, and the mind has been one with which every approach to linguistics has grappled. Cognitive perspectives hold that language is part of a cognitive system which comprises perception, emotions, categorization, abstraction processes, and reasoning. All these cognitive abilities interact with language and are influenced by language. Thus, the perspective on language offered by Cognitive Linguistics emphasizes the effect of human experience of the world, the unique way humans perceive and conceptualize that experience, and how these are in turn reflected in the structure of language itself. A central claim of all cognitive approaches is that grammar is not represented as an autonomous component. The problem of how people construct meaning in thought and language is at the heart of research in a cognitive approach to language. As such it emphasizes a usage-based conception of language and evidences a concern for contextualized, dynamically constructed meanings and for the grounding of language use in both cognitive and social interaction. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to the basic tenets of cognitive linguistics and consider how these perspectives might help us gain insights into issues concerning cross-linguistic universals and variation, cross-cultural communication, and language learning. There will be a special emphasis on applications of CL to issues in Second Language Learning. Some of the specific issues we will examine include: -The nature and ubiquity of metaphor in everyday language and what it might tell us about human cognition -Issues of lexical polysemy: the polysemy networks of English prepositions, the role of polysemy in explaining grammatical elements such as modals -The relationship of semantics and syntax, in particular the notion that grammatical constructions themselves carry meaning independently of the words in the sentence -Applications of theoretical insights to issues in language learning, both first and second READINGS: Fauconnier, G & Turner, M.

Packet of Readings Prerequisite: One of the following: Metaphor and the Mind Introduction to Cognitive and Functional Approaches to Language Syntax 1 or permission of instructor Cognitive approaches to language are relatively new. Recently they have been drawing the attention of a number of leading scholars in the areas of discourse analysis (e.g., Chafe, Gumperz, Hopper, and Thompson), first language learning (e.g., Bowerman, Slobin and Tomasello), and applied linguistics/second language learning (e.g. Nick Ellis, Bley-Vroman, Peter Robinson). There is growing interest in how the approach can be used to address issues of language description, language acquisition, and language teaching. In past years, student papers written for seminars in cognitive approaches resulted in presentations at several national and international conferences. Paper topics included: A cognitive metaphor analysis of the pragmatics of Korean negation Discourse-level metaphor in American Sign Language A cognitive blending approach to humorous discourse A cognitive metaphor analysis of Spanish ser and estar An examination of the semantic network of the German preposition uber An examination of the semantic network of German case Metaphor transfer in the Lithuanian speech of Lithuanian-English bilinguals An experimental examination of the semantic networks of in and over An effects-of-instruction study on teaching English prepositions from a cognitive perspective."

    :description: "The course will be an in-depth study of a current topic in computational linguistics. The exact topic is TBA, but might be chosen from among the following: intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL), inducing lexical resources (e.g., subcategorization information), dependency parsing, handling \"ill-formed\" or unexpected natural language input, advanced classification (categorization) techniques. More applied topics like question answering and grammar checking will also be considered, if the demand arises. Intro to NLP (Ling 362), or equivalent, is required for this course. The course is very discussion-based, focusing on weekly readings of research papers. There are two main components for students: each student will have to prepare and lead the discussion at least once during the semester, on a particular topic. They will also have to write a research paper at the end of the semester. Additionally, all students are expected to participate in the discussion every week."

    :number: "571"
    :description: Although all sociolinguists analyze language in context, the ways in which they do so vary, as do the means by which they collect data. This course provides hands-on experience with a range of different methods for collecting data on language in context. The overarching framework of data collection will be based on fieldwork in the Washington D.C. metropolitan area, in which small groups of students select a neighborhood as the site of their primary fieldwork. Through their fieldwork, students will learn about ethnography (participant observation), structured observations, interviews, narrative/oral history and rapid anonymous surveys. Our understanding of the value of each method will be enhanced through (1) mini-analyses of phenomena frequently studied by sociolinguists (e.g. style, phonological variation, turn-taking), (2) discussion and assessment of each method in terms of issues such as "record" keeping (e.g. field notes vs. checklists), objectivity/subjectivity, transcription, coding, and the relationship between theory and methodology. Students will also gain hands-on experience with other types of data (e.g. videotape) and carry out analyses based on that data. Course requirements include reading articles that (a) depend upon different types of data and (b) discuss fieldwork; completion of fieldwork projects and data analyses; participation in class discussions; a personal journal (recounting and evaluating your fieldwork and its specific phases/projects); a group report on your neighborhood study, including an analysis of some facet of language in context.

Students will review the literature on language and identity, ranging from early foundational work in sociolinguistics to the most recent debates on identity as an object of sociolinguistic study. Examining the construction of a number of aspects of identity \xE2\x80\x93 gender and sexuality, race and ethnicity, age and the life course, and nationhood, as well as how they intersect \xE2\x80\x93 will bring to the surface several important themes, among them access, agency, authenticity, community, and ideology. Together these themes will provide students with a framework for conducting an original research project on the linguistic construction of identity. In addition to carrying out this project, students will be required to present an article of their choice and to write three brief papers bringing together and building off of material in the assigned reading."

Natalie Schilling-Estes and Deborah Schiffrin in the Georgetown Linguistics Department. Students will engage in a range of research activities, including obtaining background demographic, social and historical information; engaging in participant observation; and conducting tape-recorded interviews designed to elicit a variety of speech styles and genres, including narratives about life in the DC area. As we conduct our research, we will work to ensure that we are well-versed in current best practices in the collection, storage, organization, and transcription of sociolinguistic data (and possibly computer mark-up of data as well). In addition, we will continue refining our analytic and interpretive abilities/perspectives and to address important issues in research endeavors involving human subjects, including \xE2\x80\x9Cobjectivity\xE2\x80\x9D vs. community involvement; the effective dissemination of information on language variation to non-academic audiences; Institutional Review Board approval procedures; and (sometimes tricky) issues of research ethics. The course thus provides students with the opportunity to get in on the ground floor of what promises to be an exciting and illuminating research effort, as well as providing them with the tools and concepts they need to design, conduct, and lead sociolinguistic field research projects in any community setting. In addition, students will develop (or initiate) an individual or group research project on phonological/morphosyntactic variation, discourse strategies, narrative analysis, etc., and present their findings in the form of a paper suitable for conference presentation (with accompanying abstract)."

    :description: This course provides an introduction to psycholinguistic, sociolinguistic, and policy perspectives on bilingualism. Readings cover both current and classic concepts in the field with an eye to understanding and critically reviewing essential research findings, research paradigms, and theory. The course is loosely divided into three parts. Part One focuses on sociolinguistic aspects of bilingualism, including types of bilingual societies, language maintenance and loss, and ideologies of bilingualism. Part Two addresses psycholinguistic aspects of bilingualism; here we cover issues such as the relationship between bilingualism and cognition, language differentiation, and code-switching. Finally, Part Three of the course integrates and applies these two lines of research to explore political and policy perspectives on bilingualism, including analysis of bilingual education politics and practices in the U.S. and abroad and (de)construction of English language/anti-bilingual movements.

    :description: "Classical Arab phoneticians: Ling-711-01 Spring 2007 Prof: Solomon Sara, S.J. Class: Telephone : (202)-687-6226/4004 ICC. 204A O.hs: (ICC 475) Mon & Wed 2:00-2:40 p.m. W 4:15-6:45 p.m. by appointment: anytime saras@georgetown.edu Topic of the seminar: The topic of the seminar will be the Arab linguists who explicitly dealt with phonetic/ phonological issues. Treatises and sections of treatises that deal with phonetic/ phonological issues will be the topics for discussion. The seminar will emphasize the study of the earliest Arab phoneticians . The discussion will focus on the primary sources themselves. There are certain primary texts that come to us from the eighth century that are seminal for any discussion of the phonetics and phonology of Arabic. The two 8th century authors who were the architects of Arabic linguistics are Al-Khal?l and S?bawayh. Both have included in their linguistic writings detailed phonetic/ phonological treatises on Arabic that defined the parameters of these two sub-disciplines for subsequent centuries. Other authors, like Ibn Duraid and Ibn Sina 10th century , may be discussed in the seminar as time will permit. Purpose: To explore the origins and the development of the phonetic/ phonology in a new paradigm. When approaching a new tradition in linguistics, the challenge is to determine what makes that tradition original and unique in its contributions. What is of interest in this seminar, then, is to capture the creative genius of these linguists in providing the technical terminology and the analytical tools for the study of Arabic that are unique to this tradition. The task of this seminar will be to study their texts, explore their language data, isolate their technical terms, examine their procedures, capture their theoretical orientation, and evaluate the results of their efforts in the context of the overall linguistic theory and the study of Arabic in particular. Procedures: Seminars of this type are successful when the participants, without prejudice, tackle the problems, analyze the text, disentangle the underlying theoretical assumptions, and frame their results within the context of the language that is being analyzed. The success of this seminar will depend on the participation and contributions of all the members. Pre-requisites: Interest in the history of linguistics and interest in the Arab linguistic tradition. Knowledge of Arabic is Not required. All relevant Arabic sources will be provided in translation. Members of the seminar will be assigned sections of the texts for presentation, analysis, and discussion. Even though all members of the seminar will be responsible for all the texts, the more effective method of participation is to have a leader of the discussion for each meeting who will summarize the appropriate texts, present the issues discussed in that section, analyze it, and lead the subsequent discussion. Papers: Seminar evaluations do not depend on exams that require mastery of the basic materials. The evaluations depend on active participation in the seminar meetings, and original personal contributions to the topic of the seminar. Each member of the seminar will be required to write two short and one long final seminar papers on a phonetic/phonological topic both assigned and of their choice. The topic can be drawn from the materials discussed in class or may be analyses of phonetic/ phonological topics of a linguist from the same period not discussed specifically in class. Decision on the topic, with consultation with the professor, will be due by the beginning of march.

Building from a foundation of familiarity with more traditional approaches to stylistic variation (e.g. Labov\xE2\x80\x99s Attention to Speech approach, Bell\xE2\x80\x99s Audience Design approach), we focus in particular on approaches in which language variation is no longer seen as simply a reflection of static social categories to which one more or less permanently belongs (e.g. social class, sex, ethnicity, etc.) but rather as a resource for shaping and re-shaping individual and community identity \xE2\x80\x93 i.e. for performing identity though language. Thus, we focus on performative, self-conscious uses of language rather than the unselfconscious speech styles that have traditionally formed the focus of variationist sociolinguistics. Such a focus on self-conscious performance is particularly relevant in today\xE2\x80\x99s post-modern world, a world characterized by globalization, mass mediated (re)presentations, and increasing access to a range of linguistic and other stylistic resources (and their attendant social meanings), out of which individuals can now craft styles for a variety of identificational, relational and interactional goals. Of particular interest are the very overtly performative styles that characterize public performances, including media performance, and how such performances, which are often based on \xE2\x80\x98inauthentic\xE2\x80\x99, stereotypical, essentialized views of language varieties (and social groups), increasingly are adopted (and adapted) by speakers in shaping their own personal and group styles, as well as notions of personal, cultural, and linguistic authenticity."

    :number: "782"
    :description: "Over the past twenty years or so, scholars of language and social life have been investigating language use within clinical settings, most frequently focusing on interactions between physicians and their patients. For some of these scholars, such research sites offer intriguing real-life contexts in which their favorite discourse phenomena can be examined in situ; others are lured by a concrete place in which they can investigate the role of language in the relationship between ideology and practice; still others are attracted by an opportunity to work towards the solution of important societal problems such as those sometimes displayed in the talk between physicians and patients, physicians and nurses, health care counselors and their clients, etc. In this course, students will have the opportunity to build on their knowledge and practice of discourse analysis by investigating the talk that occurs within a range of clinical contexts. During the first few weeks of the course, students will read and discuss both classic and current readings in the field of discourse and medicine in order to become familiar with the wide range of language issues dealt with by researchers in this area. With that background, students will then design and carry out investigations of audio- or videotaped health care interactions. Students may work on interactions that they have taped themselves or choose to work on interactions taped as part of research and/or consulting projects with which the professor is associated, such as HEALING WORDS (physician-patient interactions centered on 30+ diseases or conditions, ranging from diabetes to hepatitis C to lung cancer), STORYTELLER (life stories told by patients and health care workers), GENETIC COUNSELING AS DISCOURSE (interactions between genetic counselors and their clients regarding hereditary health problems or chromosomal abnormalities), HOSPITALK (interdisciplinary discharge rounds involving a variety of health care professionals with background one-on-one interviews), and LANGUAGE and ALZHEIMER\xE2\x80\x99S DISEASE (conversations between researchers and individuals with Alzheimer\xE2\x80\x99s disease). Students who are interested in working as a linguistic consultant in the health care professions (or even in other professions, such as education or law) will find this seminar to be a solid introduction to the challenges of doing discourse analysis across disciplinary boundaries. Throughout the semester we will consider the influence of different disciplinary paradigms in all phases of our research projects -- including decisions about what research questions are thought to be both answerable and important or useful; what participants and settings can be included in a study; what kinds of language data can be collected and how; what types of theoretical frameworks and analytical units can be brought to the research; what counts as research findings; and, finally, how those findings should be reported and to whom.

The quantity and variety of spoken and written political texts, the wealth of genres and rhetorical styles, and the intensity of the political word offer rich arenas for the study of language. We will approach this task from both communication and linguistic perspectives while examining campaign communication, political speeches, advertising, debates, and media coverage. The linguistic focus will highlight discursive practices of argumentation and persuasion, as well as the use of metaphor, framing, and politeness. We will also consider the changing landscape of global political language after September 11. Different approaches to the language of politics \xE2\x80\x93 from communication theories to cognitive and pragmatic methods \xE2\x80\x93 will help us shed light on the Aristotelian claim that we are all political animals, able to use language to pursue our own ends.

    :description: The goal of the course is to provide an introduction to the functional analysis of language, using Hallidayan systemic functional linguistics as the theoretical frame of reference and English as the exemplar language. The course introduces students to general concepts of this socioculturally oriented model of grammar with its explicit focus on meaning in oral and written texts and familiarizes them with different conceptual and analytical tools that are available for such analyses. Because systemic-functional linguistics provides considerable resources for literacy-oriented and interpretive approaches to language learning and use, it is particularly well suited for principled approaches to the pedagogy of advanced L2 learning, including advanced reading and writing, L2 learning by heritage learner, and L2 instruction for academic and professional purposes.

In the first part of the course, cognitive-interactionist, sociocultural, frequency-based, input-processing and psycholinguistic perspectives on SLA are discussed together with factors that influence the L2 learning process (including individual differences). The application of SLA theory to understanding L2 learners' interlanguage production will be explored, including work on classroom/instructed L2 learning. The second part of the course focuses on bilingualism; key topics include research and theory on the dimensions and assessment of bilingualism; the ontogenesis of bilingualism; bilinguality and cognitive development, as well as social, cultural, and educational perspectives on bilingualism. This course emphasizes the central role of both cognition and social interaction in language learning; UG approaches to child/first language acquisition are not covered in this class. (Note: Either Ling-359 or Ling-351 are required for students pursuing the MAT. Ling-359 serves as a pre-requisite for more advanced classes in SLA and/or bilingualism.)"

    :number: "381"
    :description: "Jewish communities, regardless of their different locations, have used language as a major marker of collective identity and group vitality (along with other variables such as history, ancestry and religion). The dominating linguistic pattern of Jews was often trilingual: the reading of Hebrew, the relevant territorial languages, and some Jewish language. This pattern kept changing over history, often related to political developments that brought about different language ideologies and practices, especially towards and after the establishment of the state of Israel: it was then that Hebrew began to serve as a major tool representing national ideologies of Jews and symbolizing the national collective identity of Jews immigrating to Palestine. It was also then that Zionist ideology struggled against other languages of the Jews, especially against Yiddish. Nowadays in Israel, Hebrew is the official language (along with Arabic), Yiddish is used only by Ultra Orthodox communities, and English is widespread in terms of its use (after Hebrew) in all domains of life. The course focuses on and explores the different languages used by Jewish communities in the context of political entities of nation-states and institutions (schools, communities, religious and cultural affiliations) in different places where Jews currently reside. It examines these issues in historical terms as well as in current linguistic landscapes. It surveys the multiple of Jewish languages used over the years, their relationship with collective and personal identities, and the role of these languages as expressions of cultural, religious and political environments. It will examine the methods of reviving spoken Hebrew, the struggle of Hebrew against other Jewish languages. It examines the current declared and de facto language policies of Israel, the role of Hebrew in the continuous effort to maintain a political homogenous national identity, the attitudes towards \xE2\x80\x98the other\xE2\x80\x99 languages (Arabic as well as immigrant languages), and the various Jewish languages currently emerging in different Jewish communities around the world.

We will also compare these instances of agreement with phenomena robustly attested in other languages, such as the existence of classifiers (found in Chinese, Japanese, Southeast Asian languages, sign languages, among others), honorifics (in Korean and Japanese), and noun class markers (in Bantu and Caucasian languages).

    :number: "556"
    :description: Most of us are subject to tests throughout our lives, in a variety of contexts, as rites of passage and as conditions for entrance, participation, acceptance and the ability to function in schools and society. Tests are powerful tools. Language tests in particular, have the power to influence language teaching and learning, the definitions of language, and to dictate de facto language policies. This course examines the sources of the power of language tests, their influences and consequences in manipulating languages in educational and societal contexts (e.g., determining language prestige, standards, correctness, purity, and suppressing language diversity). Through the work of Bourdieu and Foucault, the course introduces a critical view of language testing; it then surveys research studies that examined the effect and consequences of tests by focusing on ethical, fairness and language rights and democratic processes. These issues will be discussed within specific examples of large scale powerful tests such as the No Child Left Behind, in the US, state wide mandated language tests, the TOEFL and language tests for citizenship, a phenomenon currently spreading in a large number of European countries. Alternative ways of viewing language tests and assessment that are more inclusive and constructive will be introduced within a more open view of languages and testing. Requirements include readings for the course and writing a paper that uses critical methods to analyze a specific language test incorporating data collection.

    :description: "Qualitative and quantitative approaches to discourse analysis are complementary. Ideally, they support a cycle of investigation. Qualitative studies initially help to identify and describe a discourse feature or pattern of communicative behavior and then may exemplify the function of that feature or pattern. Quantitative approaches can refine and strengthen our understanding of features identified in qualitative studies (through assessment of reliability of coding schemas and protocols), test hypotheses raised in those studies (about features\xE2\x80\x99 distribution across speaker groups or genres, for example), and measure relative strengths of association between features and different linguistic and contextual variables, to help us develop a more complex understanding of feature-function-context relations. Completing the cycle, qualitative analysis can give \xE2\x80\x98flesh\xE2\x80\x99 to the \xE2\x80\x98skeleton\xE2\x80\x99 of quantitative results. Unfortunately, this complementary cycle has rarely been completed. This course will consider a number of discourse phenomena which have so far been analyzed only/mainly via qualitative approaches, and investigate how quantitative analytic methods might extend and enhance our understanding of those phenomena. The course will focus on four facets of discourse structure: Interactional discourse features (discourse markers, politeness features) (Written) Rhetorical structure (moves, cohesion) Functional interpretation of cooccurrence patterns (register analysis, indexicality) Psychological constructs (attitude research and Q-sort methodology) For each facet of discourse, students (working in groups) will develop coding protocols based on previous (primarily) qualitative studies and assess their intercoder reliability (using an already collected testbed of data). Each student will write a critique of a previously published quantitative study. For students taking the course at the 575 level, the final project will be to develop a proposal for a quantitative replication of a qualitative study.

Issues of language policy referring to the languages that should be used and practiced in these societies thus get special focus as traditional views of one nation/one language are no longer appropriate representations of the diversity and as they often lead to exclusion of groups and violating personal and collective rights. The course examines and focuses on the role that Language Policy plays within complex current multilingual/multicultural contexts in the current nation states as is manifested in various social domains (e.g., hospitals, schools, work places). Expanded views and definitions of language policies will be introduced that examine ideologies, policies and practices that go beyond declared and explicit policies (e.g., official documents, laws, officially) to also include implicit and covert policies to be deduced from language practice through educational practices, language tests and language in the public space (e.g., linguistic landscape, the internet, instructions, signs, etc.). Specific multilingual sites within the US and elsewhere, where different types of language policies are practiced, are examined in terms of ideology, policy and practice. Requirements include readings and writing a paper that examines language policy by using expanded notions of language policy and incorporating actual data.

How does the interaction hypothesis articulate with (or subsume) the output hypothesis and the noticing hypothesis? This course provides an in-depth study of the role of input and interaction in second language acquisition. The focus is recent and current research relating to theoretical perspectives and empirical findings on the developmental outcomes of different types of input and interaction. Topics of current concern in the field are discussed. Experimental studies of the value of different kinds of interactional feedback, the role of salience, the role of context and setting, the role of the learner's interlocutor, and the issues of attention and working memory in relation to learner-internal characteristics are considered. Age, gender and motivation are also discussed. The course finishes by addressing the application of work on interaction to teaching practice, through the approach known as task-based language teaching. All class participants will carry out original empirical research, either individually or as part of two class projects. The research to be carried out addresses different aspects of input and interaction according to individual interests, through a hands-on approach to developing research questions and hypotheses, identifying potential subject pools, data collection, transcription, coding, analysis and discussion.

    :number: "784"
    :description: "Intertextuality is a notion which has become widely used as a theoretical framework within the field of literary criticism since it was first named as such by Kristeva (1974), drawing on Bakhtin (1965, 1973, see also 1981). Over the past decade or so, linguists have shown an interest in the notion of intertextuality; prior texts are seen to be important to general linguistic theory as well as to an understanding of textual meaning and the discursive construction of identity and ideology. But both the theoretical approaches and the types of texts used in the two fields are so different as to make one believe that any similarity begins and ends with the label \xE2\x80\x98intertextuality\xE2\x80\x99. It is the aim of this course to bridge the chasm between literary approaches and discourse analytic approaches as we attempt to move the notion of \xE2\x80\x98intertextuality\xE2\x80\x99 from that of a multidisciplinary nature (i.e., of interest to different disciplines) to that of an interdisciplinary nature (i.e., drawing on and synthesizing the analyses of different disciplines). After becoming familiar with foundational works on intertextuality in both fields, students will collect spoken and/or written texts and use these to ground their emerging understanding of intertextuality. As we begin to operationalize the notion of intertextuality, we will grapple with a variety of issues due, in part, to disciplinary differences between literary criticism and linguistics. Two of the most critical issues are 1) the definition of \xE2\x80\x98text\xE2\x80\x99 and, subsequently, of \xE2\x80\x98intertextuality\xE2\x80\x99 and 2) the role of author meaning and intentionality.

  - :name: "Seminar: Intertextuality"
    :number: "787"
    :description: "Intertextuality is a notion which has become widely used as a theoretical framework within the field of literary criticism since it was first named as such by Kristeva (1974), drawing on Bakhtin (1965, 1973, see also 1981). Over the past decade or so, linguists have shown an interest in the notion of intertextuality; prior texts are seen to be important to general linguistic theory as well as to an understanding of textual meaning and the discursive construction of identity and ideology. But both the theoretical approaches and the types of texts used in the two fields are so different as to make one believe that any similarity begins and ends with the label \xE2\x80\x98intertextuality\xE2\x80\x99. It is the aim of this course to bridge the chasm between literary approaches and discourse analytic approaches as we attempt to move the notion of \xE2\x80\x98intertextuality\xE2\x80\x99 from that of a multidisciplinary nature (i.e., of interest to different disciplines) to that of an interdisciplinary nature (i.e., drawing on and synthesizing the analyses of different disciplines). After becoming familiar with foundational works on intertextuality in both fields, students will collect spoken and/or written texts and use these to ground their emerging understanding of intertextuality. As we begin to operationalize the notion of intertextuality, we will grapple with a variety of issues due, in part, to disciplinary differences between literary criticism and linguistics. Two of the most critical issues are 1) the definition of \xE2\x80\x98text\xE2\x80\x99 and, subsequently, of \xE2\x80\x98intertextuality\xE2\x80\x99 and 2) the role of author meaning and intentionality. Prerequisite At least one course in discourse analysis or permission of instructor Requirements Attendance is required; active participation in class discussions based on required readings and analysis of texts is expected Collection of appropriate data set for the analysis of intertextuality One in-class oral presentation, including assignment and discussion of relevant reading(s) Reading journal (reflections on readings, including discussion of relevance to student\xE2\x80\x99s own data set; responses to other students\xE2\x80\x99 presentations) Final paper"

    :number: "797"
    :description: "As a core theory course, this seminar will introduce students, particularly those who plan to work in cultural and media studies, to the foundational theories of the multiple disciplines and discourses that the field of culture and media studies incorporate. Seminal texts in literary, cultural and media theory, historiography, psychoanalysis, social theory, and ethnography will be discussed as they inform how we interpret cultural expressions and products. The intent of the course is to establish both an historical grounding of current theories and to expose students to contemporary theoretical orientations that address pertinent questions for their work. The general orientation of the course is the relationship of the study of culture to ideology and institutions such as the state. We will also address the status of \xE2\x80\x9Ctexts\xE2\x80\x9D and the construction of meaning in them that is mediated through language and image within these determining interests and contexts. Areas of focus will include: 1) semiotics and semiology, 2) hermeneutics, 3) (post) structuralism 4) feminism, gender, the body and sexuality, 5) race and ethnicity, 6) (post)colonialism, and 7) technology and media. Readings will be both interdisciplinary and international with attention to these factors as well. Substantial reading, discussion, some short papers (2-3 pgs) will be required and a take home final exam."

    :description: "In the past half-decade three non-democratic regimes were removed from power by organized, civilian-led movements. In Serbia (2000), Georgia (2003), and Ukraine (2004-05), broad-based coalitions of citizen groups used nonviolent \xE2\x80\x9Cweapons\xE2\x80\x9D including demonstrations, strikes, boycotts, civil disobedience and noncooperation in order to strip power away from regimes that governed without popular consent. In Lebanon (2005), a nonviolent mass uprising forced the withdrawal of Syrian troops in what is being called \xE2\x80\x9CBeirut Spring\xE2\x80\x9D. In Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Azerbaijan, Syria, Egypt, Iran, and China, and the United States, opposition movements demanding government transparency and accountability are using active nonviolent resistance to achieve various political, economic, and social objectives. This seminar proposes an in-depth study of nonviolent conflict, which is a method of popular struggle used by groups around the world to fight for basic rights and political change using disruptive - albeit nonviolent - tactics and strategies. The course will begin with a discussion of the main theories underlying nonviolent conflict, including theories of power, contention, and strategy. We will employ analytical insights from various academic disciplines (security and strategic studies, sociology, philosophy, international relations, conflict studies) to analyze the dynamics underlying civilian-led struggles.

  - :name: Statecraft and Negotiation
    :number: "624"
    :description: "Course Overview This is a class that will look at American foreign policy through a particular lens, the lens of statecraft. Statecraft is much more than only how to conduct the business of foreign policy. Rather it is involves the orchestration of all the instruments of power and influence to protect against threats and to promote broad national interests. Clearly, statecraft also must involve developing strategy, defining objectives and purposes, identifying the means available for pursuing that strategy, and then knowing how best to employ those means. If there is one instrument or policy tool that is central to nearly all forms of statecraft, it is negotiations. This course will, thus, take a closer look at the American approach to negotiations and how best to pursue them. It will also explore mediation as a policy tool both with regard to helping to settle or defuse local and sectarian conflicts as well as with regard to promoting a more favorable image of the US internationally. To set a context for understanding statecraft and how it can best be employed, the initial part of the course will focus on our ethos and self image. Foreign policy, its purposes, our role in the world and how we exercise it must all be related in some fashion to how we see ourselves and what has inherent credibility with the American public. Readings from Henry Kissinger's book, Diplomacy, and from my forthcoming book on statecraft will form the basis of the discussion for the first part of the course. The next section of the course will be geared toward distilling what are the essential parts of statecraft by looking at several historical and contemporary cases in which different administrations identified important American interests and employed a variety of policy tools to try to achieve them. US policy in advance of the Suez war in 1956 and the June 1967 wars, German unification in NATO in 1990/91, the Bosnia war and settlement 1993-95, and the run-up to the Iraq war of 2003 and its aftermath will be discussed. Excerpts from Kissinger's Diplomacy and Michael Oren's book, Six Days of War, will be used for the first two cases; for the case on German unification, Philip Zelikow and Condoleezza Rice\xE2\x80\x99s book German Unified and Europe Transformed; for the Bosnia case, excerpts from Derek Chollet\xE2\x80\x99s book, The Road to the Dayton Accords; and for the Iraq war, excerpts from George Packer\xE2\x80\x99s book, The Assassin\xE2\x80\x99s Gate.. After assessing what appears to make for effective statecraft, we will in the third part of the course take a closer look from a practitioner's standpoint of policy instruments such as negotiations and mediation. Here we will use several chapters from the Chester Crocker et al volume, Turbulent Peace, as well as four chapters from my forthcoming book on statecraft. Because I will want to delve into the essence of negotiation and mediation in some depth, we will also draw on several specific negotiations from my experience in the Middle East that are outlined in my book the Missing Peace. The concluding part of the course will focus on how to use statecraft in a prospective way. We will discuss issues that are confronting the US today and explore how an effective approach rooted in statecraft would shape US choices, our policy, and the tools used to carry it out."

    :description: "Development management is a specialized management discipline focused on achieving social goals and it typically involves consensus building among diverse groups with differing values. Development managers need to work collaboratively with local groups to design, manage and evaluate projects, programs and policy reform activities. They may also be engaged to assess and strengthen local organizations that provide services to poor people. The ability to understand and respond to the special needs of women and vulnerable groups is central to development management. Drawing on current international \xE2\x80\x9Cgood practices\xE2\x80\x9D this graduate workshop provides students with practical tools, skills and methods for managing development and social change. The workshop addresses the management challenges faced by the international development agencies--and specifically, the role and skills of development managers--in enhancing development effectiveness. Combined with the Development Management Skills Clinics the workshop will provide students with a comprehensive, state-of-the practice--and highly marketable--skill set for launching their careers in international development. The course is also intended to provide students with a critical insight into their personal attitudes and biases in managing development and social change. Through a required consulting project students gain practical consulting skills and insight into how to influence (rather than control) change in a client setting. Course topics include: \xE2\x80\xA2 development management as a unique management discipline \xE2\x80\xA2 building and managing teams \xE2\x80\xA2 gender analysis and social analysis \xE2\x80\xA2 assessing development project quality \xE2\x80\xA2 structuring project organizations \xE2\x80\xA2 developing monitoring and evaluation systems \xE2\x80\xA2 project scheduling and budgeting \xE2\x80\xA2 developing winning project proposals \xE2\x80\xA2 assessing and building organizational capacity \xE2\x80\xA2 planning and managing partnerships \xE2\x80\xA2 managing policy reform Using a variety of hands-on case material, experience-based assignments and team-based methods, students will address critical development management issues through work on a sampling of \xE2\x80\x9Clive\xE2\x80\x9D projects in HIV/AIDS, environment, poverty alleviation, education and private sector development.

In addition to looking at the interaction between business and government per se, we will examine how the structures, environments, interests, agendas, and constituencies of both parties shape the interactive relationship, and drive issue and policy outcomes. The course will start with an analytic, organizing framework. We will look at governments and examine how their logics, environments, interests and agendas shape their policy responses to issues involving businesses. We will then examine businesses and how their logics, environments, interests and agendas shape their responses to issues involving governments. We will then leverage the frame developed to provide insights into business-government relations across a range of issues, actors, and geographies, in such spheres as environmental policy, intellectual property, developing country debt, national competitiveness, privatization, labor migration, and government regulation. As we move thru the course the skills of advocacy, issue analysis, policy analysis, impact analysis and concise oral and written communication will be introduced and reinforced.

This course will survey the factors relating to Iraq and U.S. policy towards that country from the early 1990s through the present, with a particular focus on public diplomacy. The survey will look at three phases of U.S. policy vis-\xC3\xA0-vis Iraq: the gathering storm in the 1990s; the immediate pre- and post-war period; and the diplo-military efforts since the reestablishment of a U.S. Embassy in Baghdad in June 2004. In the context of the Iraq issue, such factors as the following will be examined: \xE2\x80\xA2 the \xE2\x80\x9Cend of history\xE2\x80\x9D and the emergence of the U.S. as the sole superpower in the 1990s; \xE2\x80\xA2 the causes and consequences of the events of 9/11; \xE2\x80\xA2 the arrival of the Information Age \xE2\x80\x93 at a time of rapid population growth and economic and political stagnation -- in the Arab world, and the impact of these factors on the Arab street; \xE2\x80\xA2 socio-cultural developments (secularism, multilateralism, demilitarization, pacifism), economic issues (social welfare, economic stagnation) and demographic trends (birth dearth, aging population, Muslim immigration) affecting Europe and relationships between the U.S. and its European allies; \xE2\x80\xA2 religious, ethnic, economic and cultural factors within Iraq which are affecting developments there; and, \xE2\x80\xA2 challenges to U.S. foreign policy efforts deriving from the interaction of democratic governance and the new international information environment. The instructor, a Senior Foreign Service Officer, will draw on his recent assignments as Minister-Counselor for Public Affairs at the U.S. Embassies in Baghdad, Berlin and Riyadh. The primary course text will be a monograph by the instructor entitled \"Iraq: Policy and Perceptions - A Diplomat\xE2\x80\x99s View\"; course reading materials will also be drawn from several recent books on U.S. efforts in Iraq as well as from current periodical literature on the subject."

    :number: "573"
    :description: "When and how do international security institutions support cooperation for the prevention, resolution, and rectification of conflicts in the international system? According to classical mainstream security studies theories, international institutions should be useless at best and counterproductive at worst, compared to the exercise of national power and national interests in confrontations among state, sub-state, and trans-state actors in the global system. Yet international institutions are called upon at different times, for different purposes, and to differing degrees of success for dealing with the central problem of war and its effects in international relations. The course will explore and assess our state of knowledge about this puzzle and its relevance to national and international security policymaking by studying three separate areas of knowledge and expertise: theories and practices of international security institutions, the sources and resolution of conflicts and their effects, and the specific challenges and experiences of a variety of case studies of conflicts. Students will be required to submit two analytical papers (one each focusing on international security institutions, and on conflicts), and a case study that assesses the necessary conditions for cooperation in a contemporary interstate, sub-state, or trans-state conflict along with the policy implications for involving effective and appropriate international security institutions. Course meetings will combine weekly discussion and in-depth assessment of the required readings, along with periodic exercises in crisis assessment and policy formulation."

    :description: The class will cover the main multilateral International Financial Institutions (IFIs) and the informal standing groups like the G-7 and Paris Club that steer international financial and economic policy. Students will become familiar with the structure of the institutions, their main activities, and the types and purposes of IFI lending. They will examine how the institutions (IMF, World Bank, multilateral development banks, Paris Club) interact with borrowers and how national governments work to shape IFI policies through formal channels and informal steering committees like the G7 and the G-20. They will consider some key policy challenges the institutions currently face and examine how these institutions interact with, and react to, financial markets. The main focus will be on emerging market and industrial economies, rather than on low income countries and development issues, although the poverty reduction work of the IFIs and the major international debt forgiveness programs will be reviewed. Case studies will look in depth at specific policy questions and at how different actors are able to shape outcomes. Students will become conversant in the role and structures of these organizations and the relationships between the main actors shaping international financial and macroeconomic policy. They will gain an understanding of how these organizations function, how they evolve, and the key challenges they face going forward. Written work will be mainly in the form of short, focused policy papers analyzing case studies. Students will be expected to think from the perspective of different actors in the system about how an issue would or should be handled and how to achieve that. These will be operational policy papers, not research papers. Class participation will be equally important. Students will all engage in several policy debates on case studies and will be expected to defend different perspectives, not just the perspective for which they feel the greatest affinity. Students will also be expected to participate in class discussions based on assigned readings.

    :description: Demography is a key component in understanding development policy and outcomes. It is vital for students of international relations to understand the dynamics of current population growth and change in relation to trade, foreign policy, commerce and finance. Strategic planning for development can occur only with the knowledge of historical and current trends of population processes such as fertility, mortality, and migration. For instance, the median age in many Middle Eastern countries is about 19; how will those countries face the demand for jobs for this bulge of youth? How will China and India with over a billion persons each find energy resources to fuel their transition into manufacturing economies? What is the long-term effect of HIV/AIDS on the structure and composition of populations? How will developing countries adapt to a large elderly population? Students are required to attend all classes, to be an active participant in class discussions, to lead one or more class discussions, to respond on a weekly basis to a question posted on the on-line discussion tool, to write a research paper in two parts, and to present that paper orally to your classmates. Students should anticipate working 10 hours outside of class each week on readings, communicating with classmates in the on-line discussion tool, writing papers, and preparing final drafts.

    :description: "This course is aimed at those students who have some familiarity with the study of economic development in poor countries and who are interested in exploring and analyzing the leading development issues in a number of different regions throughout the world. The course is organized around six regional segments or modules corresponding to the following areas or regions: (i) East Asia; (ii) South Asia; (iii) Sub-Saharan Africa; (iv) Latin America; (v) Middle East and North Africa; and (vi) the low and lower- middle-income transition economies of Eastern Europe and Central Asia. The leading issues covered under each regional module are selected with a view to analyzing a particular issue in the context of a region in which that issue is most prominent. For example, equity and distributional issues are examined against the backdrop of Latin America, while stagnation and the need to initiate growth are analyzed in the context of Sub-Saharan Africa. Similarly, the challenge of making growth more pro-poor is studied in South Asia and the so-called \xE2\x80\x9Cresource curse\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9CDutch Disease\xE2\x80\x9D and related governance issues are investigated in the oil-rich countries of the Middle East and North Africa. The intention, therefore, is to present each major development issue in stark relief and encourage comparisons and contrasts across regions and countries where appropriate. Students may wish to take this course who have an interest in comparative regional or cross-country development studies, or who wish to better understand the development challenges in a particular country or region in a broader context, or who are in search of a region or country on which to concentrate their future study and research. For more in depth coverage of a single region, students should consider more specialized regional development courses. Students are required to write short papers on each of the regional segments. The topics/issues to be covered under each regional segment and the associated reading list for this work are attached. This work will comprise about three-fourths of the semester. During the last quarter of the course, each student is required to present a term paper to the whole class. These term papers will be on one topic from one region or a comparative regional analysis of one topic, depending on the student\xE2\x80\x99s preference. During this period, when the term papers are presented, additional class meetings may be scheduled to ensure that adequate time is available. Instructions on the format, style and content of the short and term papers will be distributed in class at the beginning of the semester. Grading The grade will be based on the six short papers submitted at the end of each regional segment (60 %), the term paper submitted at the end of the semester (25 %), the presentation of the term paper (5 %), and class participation in the seminar-style discussions during the regional segments and the presentations of term papers (10 %). Prerequisites International Finance and International Trade or the permission of the instructor. Some previous course in development is desirable. Topics The topics or issues to be covered under each of the regional segments are as follows: East Asia 1. What will it take for the East Asian Tigers and NICs to once again achieve rapid and sustained economic growth and complete the process of reducing poverty and catching up to the industrialized developed countries? 2. How can East Asia\xE2\x80\x99s Emerging Market Economies Reduce their Vulnerability to International Financial Crises? 3. Is the ASEAN Trading Block Good for its Member Countries? Stumbling Block or Building Block to Multilateralism and the WTO? 4. Is China Headed for a Soft or Hard Landing? South Asia 1. Is Growth Enough to Reduce Poverty?

The module will also explore the contractual roles of various parties in a project including owner/sponsor, design and technical engineers, contractors, supervising architects and engineers, equipment and other suppliers, government approval authorities, operations and maintenance contractors, bankers/capital markets and government financing entities. The course will make heavy use of case studies of real projects in a variety of venues with an emphasis on emerging markets. The second module will address three categories of international cross-border and cross-currency investment. Portfolio investment involves exposure to various classes of public securities including fixed income securities (bonds), convertibles, and equities offered by both public and private sector issuers domiciled in developed and emerging capital markets. Private equity and venture capital investment typically involves participation in a 10 year limited partnership managed by a fund manager who is focused on a specific investment strategy in a country or regional geography. Strategic investment encompasses green field and acquisition investments by companies in various industries in their lines of business. One class will be devoted to international hedge fund strategies. The course prerequisite is Corporate and Institutional Finance (MSFS 620) or the equivalent.

The emphasis will be on providing students with broad understanding of partnerships and thus key skills useful in analyzing and evaluating them. We will use case studies to examine a wide range of public-private partnerships, their structure and how they are increasingly important for successful corporate strategies, while at the same time they promote a broader level of involvement with host countries on the part of multinational corporations. We will look at current best practices and the various actors who participate in them. Partnerships will be dissected to gain insight into the motivations of the various actors including: multinational corporations, local businesses, national governments, bilateral and multilateral aid organizations, academic institutions, foundations, international and local NGOs. Significant attention will be given to looking at partnerships from the perspective of global corporations and how these alliances address both business operations and corporate citizenship objectives. The range of development topics for such partnerships will include human rights and anti-corruption, community engagement, environment and natural resource management, energy, trade, supply chain management, information and communication technology (ICT), remittances and financial services. Coverage will be given to partnerships in the key industries impacting development including oil and gas, apparel and footwear, financial services, food and agribusiness and ICT.

    :description: "This is a seminar on contemporary American foreign policy focusing on decision making in the U.S. government, and intelligence community support of the policy maker. The course is open only to foreign policy concentration students in the Masters in Foreign Service program. The United States has, at this moment in history, unprecedented power, but a debate rages about how best to utilize and preserve this power in pursuit of U.S. interests. This debate has become particularly intense in the wake of 9/11 and U.S. interventions in Afghanistan and Iraq. This semester we will focus on four cases intended to illuminate U.S. decision making around the use or potential use of force: President Lyndon Johnson\xE2\x80\x99s 1965 decision to escalate U.S. involvement in Vietnam, U.S. decision making at the time of the fall of the Shah of Iran 1978-79, the 1998-1999 Kosovo crisis, and the 2003 Iraq War and its aftermath. These \xE2\x80\x9Ccases\xE2\x80\x9D will be examined as part of a broader examination of contemporary American foreign policy and, especially on decisions taken by President George W. Bush. We are particularly interested in the factors determining major foreign policy decisions - how U.S. national interests are defined in times of crisis, in the use/misuse/non-use of intelligence by policy makers, in the assumptions held by policy makers, and in the impact of these assumptions on policy decisions. We will want to identify \xE2\x80\x9Clessons\xE2\x80\x9D from these cases. While the central focus of the four cases will be on decisions to use (or in the case of Iran, not to use) force, students will have the opportunity, in the research on their papers and in class discussions, to explore a fuller range U.S. national interests. Ultimately, our goal is not to come down dogmatically one way or another on decisions made by American presidents but rather to illuminate how policy makers struggled with the choices presented them. In so doing, we will gain an appreciation of the challenges confronting decision makers as they manage bad choices and, inevitably, must chose between competing interests."

  - :name: Strengthening Governance and Building State Capacity
    :number: "656"
    :description: "\xE2\x80\x98Governance\xE2\x80\x99 has emerged as a central theme in economic, political and social development, and international assistance programs. There is a growing recognition that how societies are governed largely determines how successful they will be in tackling poverty, expanding opportunity and achieving sustained development. In the 1990\xE2\x80\x99s the international community (driven largely by the transition from communist societies in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union) saw the primary governance problem as the state. The challenge was to diminish, curtail or overcome its power. As a result, there was a heavy emphasis on support for civil society, democratic elections, mechanisms for citizen participation and popular accountability. More recently, however, fragile, failing and failed states in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Iraq, Palestine, West Africa, parts of Sudan, Somalia and Haiti have all demonstrated the extent to which collapsed state capacity can result in massive humanitarian crises, significant regional stability and direct threats U.S. national security. Without sufficient state capacity to maintain security and order, enforce laws, mobilize resources, and deliver services, no external military occupation, financial aid, technical assistance or political support will yield meaningful results. This course will analyze the recent and growing worldwide interest in building state capacity: how it is defined; what the drivers of poor governance are; how state capacity is assessed; and how it can be strengthened. There is a strong emphasis on identifying, articulating and critically examining the strategic assumptions and underpinnings of programs to strengthen governance and improve state capacity. The course deliberately draws on two distinct sources of analysis and insight: academic literature, and the experience of managers of development programs. Course participants can expect academic analysis to alternate with case studies, operational handbooks and program evaluations. The objective is to draw on academic literature, but to \xE2\x80\x98test\xE2\x80\x99 academic hypotheses against the operational guidelines and experiences of development agencies."

Microenterprises are generally defined as businesses with fewer than ten employees that are owned and operated by low-income individuals or families. Microenterprise development programs provide services that are designed to support microentrepreneurs in the growth of their enterprises. Course discussion and readings will review four basic levels in microenterprise program design for both domestic and international programs: the microentrepreneur, microenterprise service providers and the microenterprise national and international policy environment. Students will acquire an understanding of the basic factors which shape the environment of \xE2\x80\x9Cmicroentrepreneurs\xE2\x80\x9D and the types of services which they demand to advance their socioeconomic growth. By the end of the course, students should have acquired sufficient skill-sets to participate in a microenterprise program design team."

    :description: "Terrorism and the effort to combat violent extremism are at the top of the national security agenda. U.S. citizens, embassies, and military assets continue to be targeted by terrorists, and the threat to the homeland remains undiminished. This course focuses on the policy challenge posed by modern terrorism and examines the government's response to that challenge. We begin with an examination of the evolution of terrorism and the rise of al Qaeda and like-minded terrorist groups, U.S. counterterrorism efforts, the scope of the terrorist threat, and the tools terrorists use to fund themselves and organize their networks to select targets. We will then take an in-depth, critical look at current US government policy structures and the nature of interagency counterterrorism efforts. We will conclude by taking a hard look at emerging counterterrorism challenges that will confront policymakers in the years ahead: the threat posed by WMD terrorism, the effort to measure \"progress\" or \"success\" in the war on terrorism, and perhaps the hardest question of all, how to counter violent extremism in parts of the world where U.S. influence is limited and our policy choices less than ideal. This is a policy course. Course assignments are structured to teach students to provide concise and insightful advice to senior administration officials and the President on real world counterterrorism issues. Guest lecturers from U.S. government agencies and other public policy organizations will periodically join the seminar to provide their perspective on the terrorism problem and to discuss their role as an agent of counter-terrorism. The objective of the course is to equip students to contribute as active players in the dynamic policy environment of the U.S. Government, where real life events shape policy decisions each day. At the end of the course students should have a grasp of the current terrorist threat, understand how the U.S. Government organizes itself to counter the threat, and have developed skills that will allow them to participate in the formulation and execution of counterterrorism policy."

The current US disease surveillance systems have failed to detect these events in a timely fashion. Examples include the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the escape of Rift Valley Fever from Africa, the foot and mouth disease pandemic, West Nile virus translocation to the US and continental ecological establishment, SARS, and recently, the appearance of mad cow disease (BSE) and translocation of monkeypox to the US. This course will examine the historical, sociological and technical reasons for these failures, current attempts to improve American biosurveillance and the public policy debates surrounding the general issue of \xE2\x80\x9Cbiosurveillance\xE2\x80\x9D. Students will work on projects designed to produce an integrated approach to biosurveillance, with an emphasis on understanding the key technical issues. \xE2\x80\x9CIntegrated biosurveillance\xE2\x80\x9D refers to merging multiple data sources such as remote sensing, climatology, transportation, vector surveillance, and population density within the virtual environment of Geographic Information Systems (GIS) in order to share information across the medical, public health, transportation, agriculture, and animal health communities. Students will participate in simulations of bioterrorist attacks and pandemic outbreaks conducted at the local, national, and international levels for an illustration of the use of surveillance to trigger response and current limitations of global biosurveillance. Given its interdisciplinary approach, the course seeks students from multiple disciplines including ethics, history and the social sciences as well as the basic and applied sciences. Students will choose an appropriate subject and acquire the technical skills necessary to complete a successful project in the course."

    :number: "555"
    :description: "In order for biodefense strategies to be effectively developed, they must be based on an accurate assessment of the threat of biological warfare (BW) and bioterrorism. One formula often used to assess this threat is Threat = Vulnerability x Capability x Intent, where Threat is the probability that a given adversary will carry out an attack that inflicts injury or damage; Vulnerability is the extent to which a potential target is open to attack; Capability is whether the adversary has the technical and organizational ability to attack effectively, requiring the successful navigation of four major hurdles: acquisition of a pathogenic strain, production, formulation, and effective delivery; and Intent is whether the adversary is motivated to attack. The aim of this course is to achieve a clear understanding of each component of this threat assessment formula in order to adequately address the present and future threat of biological weapons use; the assessment may then serve as a conceptual framework for further in-depth analysis of the subject matter. Ultimately, because vulnerabilities are established and both intent and organizational capability have been demonstrated, whether a state, group, or individual can overcome the technical hurdles to an offensive biological weapons capability may determine whether an attack is attempted and, if so, whether it is successful."

    :number: "601"
    :description: "Focus area: Integrity of science in three branches of government.(Some treatment of physical and social sciences, but concentrating on biological sciences.) Rationale. An extremely important driver of a nation-state\xE2\x80\x99s economy is its rate and quality of scientific and technological innovation. Although private investment now exceeds government expenditures in S&T, public sponsorship remains very prominent in terms of total dollar quantity (especially when compared internationally), but also in terms of the types of research that are funded by public sources. It is argued that the government is in a position of underwriting high risk, but high payoff (HRHP) research, which private industry naturally eschews. To a large degree this claim is correct. For example, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which zealously sponsors HRHP projects, has an annual budget in excess of $3B. HRHP investment has produced such game-changing breakthroughs as the internet (among many others). Quantities of investment and types of research sponsored are clearly important for the economic health of the nation. Perhaps more important than the volume of research and velocity of technology to market is the appropriate use of S&T within government. This issue is important from the standpoint of technical propriety, certainly, but it is also important in terms of ethical and moral propriety as well. And the importance is equally salient, whether one considers science findings in the Administration, the Congress, or the Judiciary. Quite often scientific issues become politicized, as in the moral vs. scientific polemics associated with stem cell or global warming research. Moreover, because people are political animals, the truly objective scientific issues sometimes seem to become screamed rather than deliberated. It is imperative that the highest integrity be maintained within the government--where science and its application are mutually dependent. There are several mechanisms that serve to ensure scientific integrity in government. These include built-in programmatic or expert reviews, peer-review, measurement, voting, and legal thresholds for the introduction of evidence (in court rooms). This seminar examines such issues, from the perspectives of legislative, executive, and judicial branches of government. The course will begin with a rigorous treatment of characteristics and definitions of sound science and the roles played by governments world wide in managing research. We will then examine each branch, beginning with a look at the original authority\xE2\x80\x94the U.S. Constitution, and relevant case law. Then we will treat 5 \xE2\x80\x93 10 specific topics endemic to each branch of government. Readings will be pre-assigned and discussed in class. Students will be graded on participation and evaluation of a research paper."

The class will review a theory of direct and indirect economic factors in the innovation system, note the innovation-based competitive challenges now facing the U.S. economy, review comparative efforts in other nations, study the varied models for how federal science and technology mission agencies are organized, including a focus on life science, the growth of public-private partnership models as a way for science mission agencies to pursue mission agendas, the appropriate limits on the governmental role, and a range of new theoretical approaches to innovation organization - the cluster theory of regional innovation-based development, and complex systems and commons theory. Emphasis will also be placed on examining the organization and role of medical science innovation agencies, gaps in the health innovation economic model, and on policies that could help fill those gaps in health innovation. The mechanisms through which government obtains the science advice that is increasingly important to public policy will be discussed as well as the future of the science talent base. The class will review pending proposals for improving the government-related elements of the innovation system on an ongoing basis.

    :description: "Photography is many things: it is a technical process, a documentary tool, a personal memento, a form of art, a tool for propaganda, a device to generate commerce, or any combination of these elements. It is both an act and the thing created by that act. Its apparent subject matter can be portraiture, still life, landscape, couture fashion, historical artifact, criminal evidence, scientific data, or any combination thereof. Why photograph was taken and what it means to a viewer can vary wildly depending on its physical condition, its provenance, and the different \xE2\x80\x9Cgiven circumstances\xE2\x80\x9D (a term borrowed from the theatre) under which is was taken and under which it is viewed. The who, what, when, where, why, and how of these separate acts are frequently at odds with one another -- when they can be determined at all. Perhaps most importantly, photography is simultaneously ubiquitous and nearly invisible. From its earliest days, now nearly 200 years ago, photography has been thought of as a window on reality. Even the most sophisticated viewers tend to see the thing represented, accepting it as truth, while failing to see the thing that is the photograph itself, let alone the intellectual, artistic, technical, and political process of which it is the end result. But as the late Richard Avedon put it, \xE2\x80\x9CAll photographs are accurate. None of them is the truth.\xE2\x80\x9D The \xE2\x80\x9Cthingness\xE2\x80\x9D of the photograph and the multiple processes that create it affect our understanding of the thing represented. How the photographer sees affects what the viewer sees. This course will examine photography as both a way of seeing and a mode of rhetoric. We will approach the topic historically, but the markers of change over time \xE2\x80\x93 the technical innovations, the varying subject matter, and the generations of men and women who have made photographs for innumerable reasons \xE2\x80\x93 will not be considered as milestones of progress. Our purpose will not be to gauge the distance that separates us from photography's 19th century pioneers, Niepce, Daguerre, and Talbot \xE2\x80\x93 nor, for that matter, from such famous 20th century practitioners as Adams, Weston, or Evans. Rather, we will explore these historical markers as accretions, like the layers of a pearl, on the core human need to make images of the world."

Ballet, modern dance, theatrical dance, dance in the movies, and social dance were all undergoing great changes as well as burgeoning popularity; and there was significant overlap between types that are today considered quite distinct. Ballet pioneer George Balanchine and modern dance choreographer Agnes de Mille not only innovated within "serious" theatrical dance but also made dances for Broadway and the movies; Fred Astaire brought social dance to a highly polished theatrical level with both his sister Adele and Ginger Rogers; football and hockey player Gene Kelly turned down a position with the Ballets Russes and went on to revolutionize dance on film; tap dance was, like rock and roll, an product of American racial interaction. This was also a period in which social dancing was a major shaping force of popular culture, from the swing of the 1930s through the jive of the 1940s and a string of Latin dance crazes, culminating in perhaps the greatest dance revolution of the century, the Twist. Other key figures include Martha Graham, Bill Robinson, Shirley Temple, Sonja Henie, the Nicholas Brothers, Eleanor Powell, and composers Aaron Copland, Richard Rodgers, and Elliott Carter.

Understanding the principles underlying information processing in vision is likely relevant also for other sensory systems and other aspects of cognition. This is a challenging task, however, because it requires several levels of understanding, from the computational level, over the level of cellular and biophysical mechanisms and the level of neuronal circuits, up to the level of behavior. This course will examine the neural bases of visual processing, motivated by the computational demands of vision in a complex natural world. Topics will range from contrast processing in the retina to the neural bases of reading and facial expression recognition, focusing on physiological and brain imaging studies of the mammalian visual system, behavioral studies of animals and humans, and neuropsychological data as well as ideas from machine vision, demonstrating how the integration of these techniques has been so successful in furthering our understanding of vision. We will also discuss parallels in sensory processing between vision and other sensory modalities (in particular audition). Open to graduate and undergraduate students from neuroscience, psychology, computer science, and related disciplines. Undergraduate students should contact the course director for permission. Prerequisites: Basic knowledge of neuroscience and/or psychology. A little computer science can\xE2\x80\x99t hurt. Willingness to learn whatever background is lacking. Contact the course director if unclear. Course Structure and Requirements Classes will be three hours. Each class will consist of approximately 90 minutes of lectures by Dr. Riesenhuber and 45 minutes of student-led presentations and discussions of research papers. These presentations should include critical analyses of the methods and results, along with a discussion of the implications of the findings. All class members will be expected to have read these papers and participate in the discussions. A final project will be due on the last day of the course. It will take the form of a research grant proposal on an aspect of a vision (broadly defined) chosen by the student. The proposal should explicitly state hypotheses that will be tested. It will include specific aims of the research grant, background information about the aspect of vision studied, and a description of a series of experiments to address the specific aims. The proposal must include a discussion of what conclusions can be made depending on various outcomes of the experiments. An outline of the proposal must be approved by Dr. Riesenhuber before the final paper is written. Participants\xE2\x80\x99 grade will depend on two paper presentations (30%), participation in discussions (30%), and the final project (40%)."

    :description: Suppose you have been given the responsibility of determining whether your firm should expand its sales region to include the southwestern part of the United States, or India. Before making your decision, you would probably want answers to many questions. Even if it were possible to obtain accurate answers (perfect information) to these and other pertinent questions, your decisions problem would be extremely complex and, realistically, you cannot expect to receive perfect information. Thus, in making your decision, you will face the more complex problem of having to deal with answers about which you are uncertain. The first part of this course will center on Decision Analysis. Decision Analysis is a systematic approach to solving problems under conditions of uncertainty. It does not describe how or why an individual makes a decision; rather, it prescribes a decision for the individual that is consistent with his/her preferences and attitudes towards risk. The second part of this course will be based on Design of Experiments, analysis of variance, the chi-square test and analysis of Contingency tables.

    :description: The study of decision-making has become increasingly important as agendas (personal, organizational, governmental, etc.) have shifted toward global perspectives, shorter time frames, and greater data availability. This course provides the capstone for the Operations and Information Management major but is open to all majors. The purpose of the course is to study advanced topics in decision support systems--a broad term used for technology designed to enhance effective decision making. Topics will cover human decision processes, problem identification and formulation, interface design, and systems implementation. The Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) programming language within Microsoft Excel will be the primary tool for basic systems development and will be taught through a series of lab sessions (no prior programming knowledge required).

  - :name: Global Logistics and Supply Chain Management
    :number: "262"
    :description: The emphasis of the course is the logistics function in firms that source, produce, distribute and market in multiple nations. The management of logistics in such firms differs from its domestic counterpart along several key dimensions. First, there is the need to be able to identify and analyze factors that differ across nations, which influence the effectiveness of this function. These include worker productivity, process adaptability, governmental concerns, transportation availability, culture and so on. In addition, because of the distances involved, transportation and distribution are of greater significance. Finally, these geographically dispersed facilities and markets must be integrated and manage to enhance the strategy of the business unit. Some of the sessions of the course will focus on cross-national decisions and others will focus on managing across nations. Global logistics is the response to the increasing integration of international markets as firms try to remain competitive taking into account the challenges that e-commerce and the new economy imposes. Throughout the course we will emphasize the role that emerging technologies are playing within the supply chain and e-commerce. Formerly offered as MGMT 262.

    :description: Utilitarianism, the view that our moral duty is to make the world better, is the most well-developed and carefully examined of all ethical theories. In the first half of the semester, we will examine various formulations of the theory and various objections to it. In the second half of the course we will consider alternative theories of moral duty. Readings will include classical philosophical texts as well as more contemporary writings. One goal is to see and appreciate how philosophers have thought about problems of identifying what is right and wrong, good and bad, virtuous and vicious. A second, equally important, is to get students thinking about these problems for themselves. The course emphasizes ethical theory, rather than its application to controversial aspects of contemporary life. Assignments & Expectations of Students There will be both lecture and discussion classes. Students will complete a number of very short ungraded assignments, write several more formal papers and take a final exam.

    :number: "020"
    :description: "Introduction to Philosophy is composed of multiple sections. Choose from the following: Sections01-10 - Freedom11 - I and the Other12 - Questioning13 - EudaimoniaSections 01-10: Introduction to Philosophy: FreedomCourse Goals & DescriptionWhat is human freedom? Is there such a thing anyhow? We will look at several of the conceptions of human freedom offered in the Western philosophical tradition, including: the traditional thesis that freedom consists in choosing in accordance with reason and morality, Nietzsche's aestheticist view that freedom consists in autonomous self-creation analogous with artistic creation, Hume's determinist skepticism about the reach of human freedom, and James's pragmatist defense of pure free will. Students will tangle with these positions by evaluating their plausibility and the force of the arguments offered to support them. (This course uses weekly discussion sections). Texts & Readings1. Pereboom, ed., FREE WILL (Hacket). 2. Nietzsche, ON THE GENEALOGY OF MORALS, Kaufmann trans. (Vintage). 3. Hume, A TREATISE OF HUMAN NATURE (Penguin). 4. James, ESSAYS IN PRAGMATISM, Castell ed. (Hafner). 5. Strunk & White, ELEMENTS OF STYLE (Longman). 6. Woodhouse, PREFACE TO PHILOSOPHY (Wadsworth)-recommended. Assignments & Expectations of StudentsStudents will write one very short preliminary paper, then three short essays (approx. 5 pp.) spaced roughly evenly through the semester. Attendance at discussion sections is mandatory. What Students Should KnowThis course has two 50 mins. lectures per week and one 50 mins. discussion section. All of the sections assigned to Blattner for Intro. to Philosophy Phil. 2 meet in plenary session for the lectures; which discussion a student attends depends on which section he or she is enrolled in. Section 11: I and the OtherThis course will address philosophically the relation of a human being to other human beings. In a first chapter, we will analyze the characteristics of philosophy. We will pay special attention to multi-culturalism as a threat to philosophy in as much as it may lead to skepticism about truth. We will use a book by Jaspers and two videos to have a summary view of six major civilizations. We will read Plato as an example of philosophical thinking. In a second chapter we will study the interdependence of single humans beings by means of a classic passage in Hegel's philosophy: the master-slave dialectic. We will use Frederick Douglass\xE2\x80\x99 Memoirs as an illustration of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s ideas. In chapter three we will study the relation of one human being with privileged others. We will do that by first studying the complexity of the human subject (jokes, slips of the tongue, denials) and then by studying the function of privileged others (parents) in the complexity of the human subject. We will make use of philosophy of psychoanalysis which will introduce us to the meaning of both mental illness and sexual difference. In chapter four we will study the consequences for a human subject of belonging to a particular nation and a particular civilization in history. Here we will rely on Hegel's philosophy of history. In a fifth and last chapter we will analyze the relationship of individuals in the capitalist system. We will, first, reflect on the relationship between economic actors in the economic theory of private, public and merit goods. Second we will study the consequences for a human person of being a member of a special class. Here we will use Marx' analysis of class conflict and class exploitation. Section 12: Introduction to Philosophy: QuestioningThe objective of the course is to introduce students to the human experience of questioning and seeking to understand the meaning of our existence as persons. The course will approach this goal in three ways: first, by reading a number of the dialogues of Plato, we shall attempt to identify those basic human questions which are important to all of us as persons and which have become the enduring issues of philosophy. Second, we shall examine how Aristotle developed a very different but complementary approach to these same questions. And third, we shall become acquainted with ways some of the major figures in the subsequent history of philosophy up to our own time have responded in very different ways to these questions. Throughout the course equal emphasis will be placed on trying to learn from great philosophers and trying to become aware of how their questions are still at issue in our own society and individual lives. Required texts:1. Plato, The Collected Dialogues, ed. Edith Hamilton and Huntington Cairns; Princeton University Press. 2. Guthrie, W.L.C., The Greek Philosophers, Harper and Row. 3. Aristotle, An Introduction to Aristotle. 4. Frankl, V, Man's Search for Meaning. Assignments:1. One short reflective paper (4 pages typewritten) 2. Two examinations 3. Take home final exam in the form of a 7-8 page typewritten essay. 4. Participation in individual\\group activities(discussion and\\or writing)outside of class as assigned Section 13: Introduction to Philosophy: EudaimoniaThe course begins by introducing students to what philosophy is about through the figure of SOCRATES and through a brief introduction to logic. In the rest of the course we read and discuss major philosophical questions, both through classical and contemporary readings and also through film. The topics include: first, what is REALITY, starting with the early Greek philosophers, including Plato and Aristotle, and various writings from Eastern sources, i.e., Persia, India and China. Next, we examine various topics in the philosophy of RELIGION, such as proofs for God\xE2\x80\x99s existence and the problem of evil and God. Then, we look at various views of TRUTH and conceptual relativism, followed by a look at various concepts on BEAUTY, specifically, those of Plato, Aristotle, Hume, Kant and others. We will also examine ETHICS, and end the course examining various views on FREEDOM AND RESPONSIBILITY. Our discussion of philosophy of religion is introduced by Tender Mercies. For the section on truth, I am thinking of the film Hilary and Jackie, while I am still looking for a good film for beauty. Questions of ethics will be introduced by Crimes and Misdemeanors, while those on freedom and responsibility are introduced by Gattaca. The films are available to be viewed on one\xE2\x80\x99s own computer outside of class through Blackboard."

    :description: "It is commonly assumed that democracy makes two small presuppositions about citizens: First, that they are capable of taking responsibility for their actions; and second, that they are capable of being responsive enough to reasons to participate meaningfully in public debate. Nowadays, many people both inside and outside the university consider those two presuppositions to be demonstrably false. People, it is said, are certainly not responsive to rationality but to something else: Desires, ideologies, power, interests, and so forth; and people, it is said, are not necessarily capable of assuming responsibility for themselves since such responsibility presupposes social conditions that aren\xE2\x80\x99t usually present in the modern world. If that is true, what is the basis and/or underlying rationale of democratic politics? To get an idea as to how in general we might go about trying to answer this question, we shall look first at one of the great classical treatises on politics: Aristotle\xE2\x80\x99s Politics. We shall then jump to an examination of modern liberal, individualist theories of government; we will put particular emphasis on two competing traditions in modernity: Social contract traditions, which try to understand political life as being legitimated by some kind of real or imagined \xE2\x80\x9Ccontract\xE2\x80\x9D or fairly explicit set of agreements among citizens and each other and between citizens and the government; and non-contractarian traditions, which try to understand the legitimating basis of political life in appeals to \xE2\x80\x9Cforms of life,\xE2\x80\x9D or common modes of participation in social and political life. Our goal will be to become more clear to ourselves about just what is at stake in such theories and what is their significance for our current conceptions of the future of democracy. Among the social-contractarians to be studied are Hobbes, Rousseau, Kant, and Rawls; among the non-contractarians will be Aristotle, Hume, Marx, Mill, and Habermas.

Hegel conceptualizes the family differently than Kant who relies on the concept of contract to define philosophically the family. The second chapter will be an exercise in philosophical anthropology making use of the psychoanalytic approach to the family. We will analyze the case of Judge Schreber, Dora and Hans. These cases will give us the opportunity to raise the question of the function of the mother, of the father and of both together. We will further clarify the function of the mother by the work of Melanie Klein, and D. Winnicott, representatives of the object relations theory, of Clancy McKenzie, and of the current theoreticians in attachment theory In a third chapter we will analyze the challenges for love in the 21st century. In a fourth chapter we will analyze a contemporary study about the price of divorce. In a last chapter we will turn to contributions of different fields for the study of the family: theology, law, and sociology. Note: The chapters will be of unequal length"

Throughout the course, we will be reflecting on the proper role of technology in shaping a flourishing human life. We will also cover in some detail the Catholic perspective on these topics, where appropriate. By the end of the semester, students will be well versed in many of the major bioethical issues of the day and will be able to reflect carefully and critically on the ethical implications of these issues. Assignments & Expectations of Students Because of its size, the course will be conducted primarily in lecture format, although there will be opportunities for discussion in most classes.

    :number: "109"
    :description: "Our actions generally pursue something, or some condition, that we take to be good, or else strive to avoid what we take to be bad. We also are generally concerned with acting rightly, as opposed to wrongly. What is the relation between goodness and rightness? We will begin (A) with two versions of the view that duties, which determine which acts are right and which are wrong, can be derived independently of any idea of what is good: (1) Kant's theory, which sums morality up in a single \"law,\" and (2) W. D. Ross's theory, which lists multiple \"prima facie duties.\" We will then turn (B) to two versions of the view that our conclusions about right and wrong must rest on prior, independent, and fixed ideas about what is good: (1) Mill's utilitarian theory, which attempted to define (morally) right action in terms of maximizing the (independently defined) social good, and (2) the somewhat more complicated approach of natural law theory. After examining reasons to think that each of these simple proposals fails, we will look (C) at a kind of moral theory that envisages a more complex relationship between the good and the right, constructive ethical pragmatism.

    :description: "This is an introductory course in ethics. It focuses on a part of moral philosophy sometimes referred to as political morality. Political morality is concerned with the moral relationship between the state and the individual. Among its concerns are questions about the role of law in enforcing or inculcating private morality, as well as the moral justification for interfering with individual thought and action for any number of other social aims, e.g., inequality reduction or promotion of the well-being of individuals. We concentrate on 3 or 4 thinkers, Aristotle, Locke, Mill, and perhaps Rawls. In addition to several required books for the course selected readings will be posted under the Assignments Tab for the course posted on Blackboard. All reading assignments are posted in a separate, detailed syllabus for each of the course segments, and these too are posted under the Assignments Tab in Blackboard a few days in advance of the beginning of each segment. Depending on whether we decide to focus on 3 or 4 thinkers, there will be either 3 essays of roughly 8 pages (3000 words) or 4 essays of roughly 6 pages for each of the segments of the course. Each essay and class participation (in-class discussion and other short assignments throughout the term) will count an equal proportion of the final grade. Office hours: liberally by appointment.

    :description: "This class is about the question: What makes someone\xE2\x80\x99s life go well for herself? Or, more colloquially, the question here is this: What makes you happy? There are three standard answers to this question. One: Pleasure theories say that what makes you well off is one thing and one thing only: feeling pleasure. Two: Desire-fulfillment theories say that what makes you well off is one thing and one thing only: having your desires fulfilled (whether this brings you pleasure or not). Three: Objective list theories say that what makes you well off is one thing and one thing only: having what is objectively good for you (whether this brings you pleasure or not, and also whether this brings you desire-fulfillment or not). Most objective list theorists advance lists that purport to name at least some of those things that are objectively good for you. Some examples of things that are often put on these lists are these: friendship, beauty, and knowledge. Much of this class will be about the strengths and weaknesses of each one of pleasure theories, desire-fulfillment theories, and objective list theories. However, these three theories are not the only available theories of human well-being; there are other available theories. We will take a look at some of these other theories as well."

  - :name: Existentialist Ethics
    :number: "136"
    :description: "In so far as it suggests a self-consciously unified school of thought, the label 'existentialism' is misleading. For many of the philosophers typically taken to be existentialists either predated the rise of the term, as in the case of Kierkegaard and Nietzsche, or rejected the label outright, as in the case Heidegger and Camus. As such, existentialism is better thought of as a trajectory of modern thought propelled by a set of roughly overlapping concerns (e.g. freedom, commitment, anxiety, the absurd, and authenticity) expressing itself variously in philosophy, literature, film, and art. In Philosophy 136, we will focus on several authors (Nietzsche, Dostoyevsky, Sartre, and Camus among others) who have had something to say about these concerns. As a bridge ethics course, we will focus primarily on what existentialism means for the nature and status of value. All existentialists are committed to the view that there is no timeless, ahistorical, transcendent source of value (say, God or Reason) that can serve to provide our lives with meaning or stand behind the choices we make. What does this picture of the human condition mean for the most basic of ethical questions: how ought I to live my live? Does existentialism lead us into a form of moral relativism or even nihilism? Or might we be able to recognize the aspects of human existence brought to light by existentialists while nonetheless affirming some positive ideal for living? These will be the central questions of our course."

  - :name: Morality Unmasked
    :number: "139"
    :description: What sort of life, if any, is worth living in a universe that is ultimately indifferent to our aims and interests? What reason can there be to take our plans and projects seriously when our very commitment to them appears to be the product of cultural and historical happenstance, random chance, or temperamental predisposition? If it is radically up to us to decide how we are to live, is there a sensible way of distinguishing a good life from a bad one? These are basic, existential questions about the ultimate status of the values to which we are attached. By confronting ancient and modern texts ranging in style and tone from Plato and Aristotle to Nietzsche and Richard Rorty, this course will help us to think carefully about what the answers concretely mean for how we should lead our lives.

  - :name: Ethics of Human Happiness
    :number: "142"
    :description: This course concerns human happiness (or well-being). The main question this course seeks to answer is 'What must something (anything) be like in order to be (intrinsically) good for someone?' There are three standard answers to this question. (1) Pleasure theories say that feelings of pleasure are the only things that can be (intrinsically) good for someone. (2) Desire-fulfillment theories say that instances of desire-fulfillment are the only things that can be (intrinsically) good for someone. (3) Objective list theories say that things that are objectively good for one are the only things that can be (intrinsically) good for her; moreover, objective list theories assume that more than merely feelings of pleasure and instances of desire-fulfillment can be (intrinsically) good for one. Primarily, our goal for the course will be to look closely at these three answers (as well as at a few other answers). Secondarily, our goal will be to try to determine what role, if any, human well-being should play in ethical theorizing, that is, in theorizing about how one should live.

  - :name: Introduction to Logic
    :number: "150"
    :description: In this course we will examine the formal structure of arguments; we will critically examine the relationship between an argument's premises and its conclusion. Initially we will expose common fallacies of reasoning that you are sure to come across in many contexts of public discourse. Then we will develop a system of formalizing the basic propositional structure of arguments, which you will use to prove that the conclusions of some arguments necessarily follow from their premises. In addition, we will utilize modern methods of semantics to uncover the deeper conceptual relationships that commonly hold among sentences of convincing arguments. You will be able to demonstrate why such arguments convince, and, perhaps, why some initially appealing arguments are nonetheless illogical. In addition to satisfying the philosophy major's requirement in logic, successful completion of this course will lead to better skills in reasoning on any topic.

  - :name: Free Will
    :number: "151"
    :description: "On one hand, it seems plausible to say that every event has a cause. But on the other hand this seems to commit us to saying that human actions are caused and that human actions are hence not free. To put it another way, we each seem to be able to freely choose to do what we do. However, if our actions are caused by things outside our control, then it might be hard to see how this can be the case. This course will be concerned with resolving these and other related dilemmas. Along the way we will consider such questions as: - Do we have free will? - Does every event have a cause? - Can freedom be compatible with causal determinism? psychological determinism? biological determinism? - Why is free will important? - What is it to have free will anyway? The course will center on in-class discussion and papers. Time and size permitting, there will also be in-class debates on the various issues."

He descended into hell; the third day He arose again from the dead. He ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from thence He shall come to judge the living and the dead. I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body and life everlasting. Amen. This and other Christian creeds are nonnegotiable elements of Christian faith. But how they are to be understood and best defended is a matter for lively debate. In this course, we will look at a variety of issues raised by the Apostle\xE2\x80\x99s Creed: (1) what is belief, and whether it is compatible with full rationality; (2) who is this being God, in whom we believe; (3) how can this God be, as the Nicene Creed later makes clear, three persons, Father, Son, and Holy Spirit; (4) how one of these divine persons, the Son, could become incarnate in Jesus Christ; (5) what is hell, and is or will any humans end up there; (6) what is resurrection, and how is it possible; and (7) what is life everlasting, and why is it worth having. Readings with be a mix of classical and contemporary, with emphasis on the contemporary. At least one of the authors we read will visit during the semester to be subjected to our critical scrutiny. Requirements include a couple of papers (6-8 pp. each) and a final examination, and prepared and active attendance throughout the semester."

  - :name: Civic Engagement & Education
    :number: "157"
    :description: "Throughout history, philosophers, political theorists, and citizen activists have argued that the existence of a vibrant and just democracy demands much more of citizens than a vote cast in a ballot box periodically; citizens must become actively engaged in addressing the social and political problems facing their communities and the larger society. In turn, as many have also argued, effective engagement demands that all youth be educated in particular ways so that they are able to participate in this activity. This course focuses on the intersection of youth civic engagement and education. Topics addressed include conceptions of civic engagement, specific examples of effective and ineffective engagement drawn from American history, strategies and models of effective engagement, the theoretical and actual role of schooling in preparing youth for civic engagement, youth attitudes toward civic engagement, and specific recommendations and strategies that can be used in educational settings to promote youth engagement. A special emphasis will be placed on the disempowerment experienced by low-income students of color in low-performing schools, and the role that schooling can play in either further marginalizing these students or empowering them. Georgetown students in this course will be expected to take a very active role in the classroom and to assume responsibility for their own, their peers\xE2\x80\x99, and the professor\xE2\x80\x99s learning in the course. Students must enroll for 4 credits. In addition to the standard twice-weekly class meetings, readings, and assignments, students will be required to complete assignments and activities related to a community-based civic engagement project. Each student will coach a small group of high-school age students on a project addressing a community problem selected by the group. Georgetown students will meet with their students on a twice-weekly basis during the school day to identify an issue for the project; research previous initiatives to address the problem and evaluate their effectiveness; and develop, implement, and evaluate the effectiveness of an original effort to address the problem. In addition, Georgetown students will be required to participate in a twice a month reflective seminar with their Georgetown peers at which they will be learn strategies for working with at-risk high school age students and discuss their experiences working with these students. Georgetown students will help plan a culminating conference at which they and their groups will present their work to the campus and local community. Those who enroll in this course do not need to have any prior teaching experience. Due to the uncertainty of the public school course schedule planning process, we don\xE2\x80\x99t know yet the days and times for the school site visits; there may be some flexibility in the schedule of these visits to accommodate Georgetown student schedules. The twice-monthly seminars are tentatively scheduled for Fridays from 4-5:30."

What\xE2\x80\x99s peculiar about the mind that has thus far eluded scientific explanation, and what do the cognitive sciences generally consider the best theory for explaining these peculiarities? 2. How does the mind relate to the world, i.e. how do the mechanisms of perception (and perhaps others) transform the world\xE2\x80\x99s causal events into the mind\xE2\x80\x99s rational reasons? 3. What is the relation between the \xE2\x80\x98parts\xE2\x80\x99 of the mind, e.g. does our capacity to recognize faces depend on our capacity to recognize shapes in general? We\xE2\x80\x99ll consider 20th century philosophical discussions of these issues as well as major works in other cognitive sciences, especially cognitive and evolutionary psychology. At the course\xE2\x80\x99s conclusion, students will have a grasp of the major difficulties facing research into the mind in the coming decades, some of the tools for approaching those difficulties, and a sense for why many past attempts seem unpromising at present."

    :description: "The purpose of this course is to examine some classic works of political philosophy, starting with Plato and Aristotle and working our way through Hobbes, Locke, Hegel, and Marx and finishing with a reading of a contemporary text that illustrates the continuing importance of this tradition. One aim is to learn to find your way around this field of thought, identify its main intellectual problems and solutions and apply its characteristic patterns of thought when reading new texts or understanding current political issues. The organizing theme is social justice, that is, the principle or principles for evaluating (1) the assignment of basic social rights and responsibilities and (2) the distribution of benefits and burdens of collective life. Every conception of social justice presupposes a theory of human nature \xE2\x80\x93 a set of beliefs about what people distinctively are and their characteristic excellences \xE2\x80\x93 and a social ideal \xE2\x80\x93 a vision of the aims or purposes of social cooperation and collective life generally. Another important goal of the course is to make explicit and evaluate these competing visions of human nature and the social life. We will also examine how these philosophers understand the fundamental political notions of democracy, liberty and equality. Throughout we will have an eye on contemporary applications of these notions."

In conjunction with watching Star Trek, we will read excerpts from the writings of great philosophers, extract key concepts and arguments and then analyze those arguments. The questions that we will wrestle with include: 1. Is time travel possible? Could we go back and kill our grandmothers? What is the nature of time? 2. Could reality be radically different from what \"we\" (I?) think? Could we be brains in vats? 3. What is the relation between a person's mind and his functioning brain--are they separate substances or identical? Can persons survive death? Can computers think? Is Data a person? 4. What is a person? When do we have one person, and when do we have two (think of the episodes where people \"split\" or are \"fused\")? 5.

    :number: "204"
    :description: "In this course we will explore philosophical questions that arise in connection with the phenomenon of history and our attempts to study and write about it. The course will fall into two parts thematically: 1. What is history? Philosophers have sought to develop accounts of what history itself is. Questions we may consider in this part of the course are: What is the difference between human history and the history of the natural world? How is human life different than it otherwise would be, because we live in and through our history? Are there historical facts, or is history an interpretation we lay over the chaos of what has happened? Are there large-scale movements and developments in history that are more than merely the aggregates of individual actions and events? 2. How should we study and write about history? Philosophers have also sought to understand how we should try to acquire knowledge about the past and how that knowledge should be presented. Questions we may consider in this part of the course are: Should we try to develop theories about what caused events to take place? Or should we try to understand the motivations that agents had for the actions they undertook? Should we merely chronicle events, or should we write narratives about the past? We will explore a variety of contemporary and classical approaches to these questions, as well as try to understand how a philosopher's answer to one of these questions should influence his or her answer to the other. Course Requirements: Students will write two mid-length (6-8 pp.) papers, one on each of the general, thematic topics (1) and (2) above in the course description. There will also between a number (between 3 and 7) of very short writing assignments (1-2 pp.) that will be graded on a \"+, \xC3\x83, -\" basis.

The basis and substance of the study will be Dante's Commedia. The approach of the course to this theme will be interdisciplinary with significant consideration being given to the function of imagination as it operates in poetry, psychology, philosophy, and theology. The unifying element in this approach would be the role of metaphor in all these disciplines, with special attention to both the similarities and the specific difference of that role in each as it appears in the poem. We will read in translation and discuss substantial portions of all three of the Cantiche of the Commedia, Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. Students will be asked to make regular use of a website designed specifically for this course incorporating the text of the Commedia in Italian and English translation, as well as images from the rich history of the illustration of the poem by great artists and commentary on the text from a variety of sources. No prior expertise in web technology is required; students will, however, be asked to become familiar with and use a few basic techniques of interactive, web-based learning. 2.

    :number: "384"
    :description: "This course surveys some of the major themes of ancient Greek and Medieval Philosophy: Knowledge and Opinion, Being and Becoming, God and the First Causes, Cosmos, Soul and Immortality, Reason and Faith. The continuity between the two periods will be stressed. We will read works of Parmenides, Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Proclus, Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and Aquinas.. Medieval Philosophy was born from the creative interaction of biblical faith with Greek philosophy. The issue, the relationship between philosophy and religious faith, is complicated because among western Christians, medieval philosophy mostly existed in the context of various theologies. But, throughout the course, we will consider the implications of \xC3\x89tienne Gilson's remark: \"A philosophy may draw inspiration from a revelation and be true, and if true, it is because it is good philosophy\" (Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1940], p. 406). Until the thirteenth century, Neoplatonism (which attempted to unify the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions) provided the dominant philosophical framework for speculative theology. The most illustrious of the Neoplatonists, Plotinus (205-270 A.D.), profoundly influenced Augustine (354-430), especially in regard to the mind's approach to divine reality through interior recollection. Augustine himself dominated subsequent western theology, as can be seen in the writings of Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109), until, in the late twelfth century, the translation and introduction of Aristotle into the Latin west provoked a philosophical revolution in regard to the prevailing Augustinianism. But the \xE2\x80\x9CChristian Aristotelianism\xE2\x80\x9D of Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), which marks a new stage in the development of medieval philosophy, was, in fact, a creative synthesis of the Augustinian-Neoplatonic tradition (especially as mediated through the Procline Neoplatonism of Pseudo-Dionysius) with Aristotle."

They have also been the source of innumerable controversies in the philosophy of art and the history of art. However, Hegel himself never published his work on the subject, and it was left to his students after his death to edit his papers and produce a volume that they hoped would have been the work he would have written if he had had the time. In this course, we will read the English translation of the original two volume compilation and editing of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s lectures on the subject.

We will consider some of the literature on laws of nature, and ask whether any of the lessons learned in the debate over the analysis and explanation of laws of nature are helpful in figuring out what a moral law is and how such might be explained. Though we will touch on questions concerning strictness that obviously bear on moral particularism, the main focus will be on the sort of necessity present in moral laws. The second thing we are going to talk about is how moral laws are to be explained. Even if moral laws turn out to be necessarily valid, how they are to be explained, if at all, remains an open question. We\xE2\x80\x99ll look at a number of (broadly realist) attempts to explain moral laws, either by reducing the necessity present in moral laws to necessity of some more tractable sort, or by giving some other, nonreductive account of why the moral necessity relations are as they are. Among these readings will be parts of the manuscript of Mark Schroeder\xE2\x80\x99s forthcoming Slaves of the Passions, some Philippa Foot and Michael Thompson neo-Aristotelianism, and some theistic stuff by Adams, Quinn, et al.

Readings will be drawn from philosophical statements on the epistemology of social science, as well as from the social science disciplines, particularly political science and anthropology.

    :description: "The Science and Society Seminar combines instruction in the humanities and the sciences to examine themes that define contemporary life. The theme for Fall 2007 is \"Biology and Society.\" No science in the second half of the twentieth century has transformed human life more than biology. The discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953 began the \"genomic age\" in which we now live. The seminar will consider major issues of that age that have become topics of public debate, including stem cells, cloning, genetically modified organisms, infectious agents, the neurobiology of cognition and memory, as well as larger issues that touch deep-seated beliefs, such as the origin of life. As these and other biological concepts are covered, students will also become acquainted with the contemporary social and philosophical issues that surround them, including the special nature of biological knowledge and how our conception both of ourselves and of the human species have been transformed by modern biology. The seminar will address such issues as: whether morality is a product of evolution, whether the complexity of life precludes the role of chance, and whether free will is compatible with current theories in biology. The purpose of the seminar is thus to enhance scientific literacy by learning how to speak about contemporary biological issues both scientifically and philosophically.

Specifically, we will try to determine to what extent important positions in their theologies were made possible by positions they had taken in their theories of knowledge so that doubts about the latter would also infect the former. Treatment of this issue in each author will be concluded with an exam on the texts covered in the lectures. Failure to study the designated texts will make it virtually impossible to do well in the course. Required texts: Introduction to Aristotle, Introduction to Thomas Aquinas, and the Critique of Pure Reason.

    :description: "This course will address philosophically the relation of a human being to other human beings. In a first chapter, we will analyze the characteristics of philosophy. We will pay special attention to multi-culturalism as a threat to philosophy in as much as it may lead to skepticism about truth. We will use a book by Jaspers and two videos to have a summary view of six major civilizations. We will read Plato as an example of philosophical thinking. In a second chapter we will study the interdependence of single humans beings by means of a classic passage in Hegel's philosophy: the master-slave dialectic. We will use Frederick Douglass\xE2\x80\x99 Memoirs as an illustration of Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s ideas. In chapter three we will study the relation of one human being with privileged others. We will do that by first studying the complexity of the human subject (over-determination of emotions) and then by studying the function of privileged others (parents) in the complexity of the human subject. We will make use of philosophy of psychoanalysis which will introduce us to the meaning of sexual difference. In chapter four we will study the consequences for a human subject of belonging to a particular nation and a particular civilization in history. Here we will rely on Hegel's philosophy of history. In a fifth and last chapter we will analyze the consequences for a human person of being a member of a special class. Here we will use Marx' analysis of class conflict. Readings: Jaspers.

Objective of the course The objective of this course is to introduce students to the human experience of questioning and seeking to understand the meaning of our existence as persons. We will study the differing, but complementary, approaches to the basic questions of human existence and the enduring issues of philosophy offered by the classical, Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle. We will also look into how some of the major figures in the subsequent history of philosophy responded quite differently to these issues. Equal emphasis will be placed on trying to learn from great philosophers and trying to become aware of how their questions are still at issue in our own society and individual lives. 2.

Among the basic ideas we will be covering will be those concerning the role of happiness, freedom, and being true to oneself. We will be asking ourselves questions such as, \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is happiness?\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9CWhat is the right conception of happiness?\xE2\x80\x9D This will require us also to ask some very general questions about how \xE2\x80\x94 or even whether \xE2\x80\x94 we can justify any particular answer that we might give, either to ourselves or to other people and why we might think (or might not think) that we should be called upon to justify such things. We will also be asking ourselves why any of us should even care about being moral. To do this, we will be examining four classic texts from Aristotle, Hume, Kant, and Nietzsche; and we will be looking at the work of a contemporary philosopher, Charles Taylor. These texts do not, of course, exhaust the scope of moral philosophy. The selection of texts is intended to give you an introduction into the way that philosophers have talked and argued about the topic of morality and to help you in thinking your way through these issues on your own.

  - :name: Slavery in Philosophy and Religion
    :number: "106"
    :description: Has religion been a force for good or evil in the world? After so many centuries of religious wars, persecutions, inquisitions (of which the events of 9/11 are only one of the most recent manifestations), one might well question whether religion has a place in civilized society. But is it really possible (or desirable) to outgrow our need for religion and to mature into a species that relies on reason alone? This course will try to address the religious issue through a case study--the history of slavery and abolition. Slavery has existed since before the beginning of recorded history, and has been (officially, at least) dismantled only relatively recently. This course will examine the long, tortuous route to the abolition of slavery. The central question will be whether the abolition of slavery has been due to purely secular, philosophical motivations or to religious ones. We will begin with slavery in the ancient Near East and trace its presence in the Bible and then in Greek philosophy. We will then examine some of the differences between Eastern and Western Christianity on the issue. We will conclude with the emergence of modern antislavery among the Quakers and the issues surrounding the slavery question before and during the American Civil War.

    :number: "111"
    :description: Ethical questions concerning life and death are of great concern to us nowadays. Is it permissible to execute criminals, to commit suicide, to kill in war? And if it is, under what conditions? These issues were the subject of intense discussion in medieval thinkers, from St.~Augustine in the late 4th and early fifth centuries to thinkers such as St.~Thomas Aquinas and others in the 13th and 14th centuries and later. Whether we agree with their views or not, their theorizing on these issues has deeply affected the way in which we think about these matters -- the distinction between just and unjust wars, for example, stems from them. This course will study medieval discussions of these issues. In particular, we will consider medieval views on the killing of animals versus humans, killing in self-defense, killing in war, the killing of criminals, suicide, abortion and contraception. The most philosophically rich discussions of these issues in the middle ages take place in the writings of theologians. The readings for this course are therefore drawn from medieval theologians and as such will make frequent reference to Christian teaching and scripture, although we will approach the material as philosophers, not theologians, focusing on the arguments presented for their views and philosophical issues they raise. At the end of each section of the course we will briefly survey some contemporary philosophical developments.

A much smaller portion of the world\xE2\x80\x99s population--living primarily in Europe, North America, and Japan--is extraordinarily rich in historical terms. What explains this extraordinary discrepancy in wealth and well being? What are the ethical implications of global wealth and poverty? What have been the strategies, successes, and failures over the past half century of efforts on the part of poor countries, aided by rich ones, to develop their economies and societies in order to reduce poverty? What are the probable future challenges of ethics and global development? In Ethics and Global Development, School of Foreign Service Professor and Director of the Mortara Center International Studies Carol Lancaster will join President John J. DeGioia in analyzing some of the ethical and practical issues surrounding global poverty. Students will consider the extent and causes of global poverty, consider philosophical and religious sources of our obligation to the poor, and examine international efforts to promote poverty reduction and economic development. The course will include several prominent guest lecturers, which will give students the opportunity to interact with and learn from some of the foremost experts in the field of global development. In the past, speakers have included Columbia University professor Jeffrey Sachs, Copenhagen Consensus founder Bjorn Lomborg, and Father Bryan Hehir from the Harvard University Divinity School. Discussion sections will discuss and debate the issues presented in the lectures. Students will be encouraged to approach the morality and means of global poverty relief critically.

Once we have more of an understanding of love in general, the second half of the course will focus more specifically on sexual love. We will discuss both general issues such as marriage and the nature and value of sexuality, as well as more specific issues in sexual ethics of contemporary controversy such as pornography, homosexuality, contraception, etc. In regard to the more specific issues, we will have an eclectic mix of readings, largely contemporary, ranging from feminist theorists to Catholic writers.

Existentialists see abstraction in the \"leveling down\" of human life by diverse forces of homogenization, such as universal morality and rationality, mass society, and modern science. In each of these forces existentialists see a threat to human freedom, a threat to the individual\xE2\x80\x99s distinctive identity and her ability to commit herself in her own voice (rather than in the voice of reason or morality or custom) to a life-defining commitment. Although existentialism is just as much literary and cultural as philosophical, in Philosophy 159 we will focus mostly on the philosophical aspect of existentialism. Existentialism is, moreover, a loose philosophical movement, rather than a school of thought. For this reason, we will be looking at several approaches to a group of problems or worries, rather than at the development of a set of doctrines. Texts & Readings Guignon and Pereboom, eds.

    :description: This course surveys the philosophical, scientific, and life-world notions of Space and Time in Western culture. In ancient philosophy Plato addressed Space as primordial chaos; the atomists as the Void; Aristotle as the measurable quantity associated with matter; and Christian as symbolic of the structure and hierarchy of Being in its divisions, namely, the human individual, society, and cosmos. In scientific cosmology, the centrality/non-centrality of humans in the cosmos was a perplexing problem for Ptolemy, Galileo, Newton, and Spinoza. Other perplexing problems concerned the vacuum, and the finitude/infinitude and reversibility/irreversibility of Time in the cosmos and in human history. Einstein transformed the notion of scientific Space and Time into one of Space-Time through the Theory of Relativity. The Big-Bang Cosmology today attempts to tell the most general scientific story of the evolutionary Universe from the beginning of Time onwards to the present and future. The quantum theory casts doubt about the 'reality' of Space and Time as existing independently of human experience and independent too of scientific culture. Phenomenology is the study of the life-world experience of Space and Time in human cultures and attempts to describe their transcendental role in all human cultures. These topics will be represented in the assigned readings.

Although in recent years the term, \xE2\x80\x9CCritical Theory,\xE2\x80\x9D has branched out to include more than the original Frankfurt School program, in this course we will pursue an introduction to the basic ideas of \xE2\x80\x9CCritical Theory\xE2\x80\x9D by reading some texts by two of the most recent proponents of the Frankfurt version of it, J\xC3\xBCrgen Habermas and his successor at Frankfurt, Axel Honneth."

In turn this sort of subversive possibility raises a yet more fundamental question: What is it to be \xE2\x80\x9Chuman?\xE2\x80\x9D In the most general sense of the term, any philosophy that attempts to understand the \xE2\x80\x9Chumanity of man\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94especially in order to distinguish and dignify man above all other animals\xE2\x80\x94can be called a \xE2\x80\x9Chumanism.\xE2\x80\x9D But the latter term has a long and complex history that runs from the ancient world to the Renaissance, and from the latter to the modern world. That history is essential for answering the question, if it is asked with any precision, whether a present-day form of humanism is viable. In the usage of contemporary historians, \xE2\x80\x9Chumanism\xE2\x80\x9D refers, somewhat vaguely, to the revival of classical ideas and ideals in the Renaissance. Its nineteenth-century antecedent, humanismus \xE2\x80\x94 a term that is a cognate of humanitas, which Marcus Tullius Cicero (106\xE2\x80\x9343 B.C.) associated with a liberal education \xE2\x80\x94 was first used in 1808, by the German educator F. J. Niethammer, to defend the central role of Greek and Latin in the secondary school curriculum. But in the middle of the fifteenth century, studia humanitatis referred to a precise cycle of studies: grammar, rhetoric, poetics, history, and moral philosophy. An umanista, in the university slang of the period, was a teacher or student of these \xE2\x80\x9Chumanities.\xE2\x80\x9D Renaissance \xE2\x80\x9Chumanism\xE2\x80\x9D was not itself a particular philosophical doctrine or school, but a cultural and educational program centering more on the study of classical Latin authors and rhetoric than philosophy. \xE2\x80\x9CPhilosophy,\xE2\x80\x9D as that term was used in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, covered a range of topics far broader than the studia humanitatis: it included the standard fields of logic, physics, metaphysics, politics, and ethics, but also rhetoric, poetics, philology, history, and even magic and astrology. This course will try to introduce the student to some important humanist themes in ancient and renaissance philosophy, in order to explore whether they continue to have a genuinely contemporary relevance."

So we'll also spend a lot of time trying to sort out what our own answers are. We'll all probably end up with different answers ourselves---but at least they'll be our own answers, and we'll have good reasons for them. Details: There will be a course packet (also online) of many pretty short readings exploring the nature of our perceptions, and our knowledge of the world. Work will consist of 3 short papers, a few quizzes, and class participation."

We will examine issues related to the philosophical, historical, sociological, and political foundations of education through the writings of Thomas Jefferson, Horace Mann, Frederick Douglas, John Dewey, Amy Gutmann, Ivan Illich, and Jonathan Kozol. Particular attention will be devoted to the multiple meanings and challenges associated with education in a liberal democratic society. We will also examine influential policies on issues such as parental rights and homeschooling, intelligent design, students\xE2\x80\x99 rights in school settings, school funding, and affirmative action. The class will be organized as a seminar and the learning of all people in the class will depend in large part on the contributions that each person makes through regular class participation. Students will take on responsibility for directing class discussions of the course readings and presenting independent research and projects on self-selected topics in education. Assignments will include a series of short (2-3pg.) reading summaries and analyses; each student will also work with the professor to develop a mutually acceptable contract identifying additional assignments to be completed."

    :description: "Philosophy of Evolutionary Biology PHIL-331-01 M/W 4:15-5:30 When one considers the vast diversity of independent factors occurring in concert needed to make the original spark of life possible and the unimaginably complex set of ongoing contingencies involved in its subsequent evolution, it becomes difficult not to think that this awesome drama had to have been guided by some kind of coordinating influence. Moreover, this difficulty becomes even more pressing if one also considers the exquisitely precise order and efficiency displayed by even the smallest operational part of a living tissue available to scientific inspection. In the light of these considerations, improbability seems to disqualify coincidence as a credible explanation. On the other hand, there are serious concerns that motivate a strong resistance to viewing these developments as the result of some sort of design. Much in the very best of contemporary philosophical writing on this subject is based on the conviction that to invoke design as an explanation would necessarily involve a form of speculation that goes beyond the reach of clear and cogent argument. My purpose in this course is to introduce the class to some of the best of the more recent writing on these topics. The course will maintain a strict neutrality on the issues and will provide the students with as wide a range of positions and arguments as time and availability of material permit. The goal is to let the students come to their own conclusion. We will lay a foundation for this enterprise by first reading a few classical texts, i.e., Aristotle on finality and chance, Kant on teleology and science, and three crucial chapters in The Origin of Species. We will then read selectively in Kuppers\xE2\x80\x99 Information and the Origin of Life(MIT, 1990), Robert Brandon\xE2\x80\x99s Concepts and Methods in Evolutionary Biology (Cambridge, 1996), and Allen\xE2\x80\x99s (et al.) Natural Purposes (MIT, 1998). The heart of the course will be the discussions of assigned articles and chapters. Everyone will be expected to submit an outline of the argument contained in the assigned material before it is discussed and participate fully in the discussions. Students will take turns at priming the discussion by presenting a short critical commentary on the designated writing. Finally, everyone will write a short (5 pages +) review of a recent book (not used in the course) that presents a broader view of the issues than can be found in articles. The book may be one selected from my library on this subject or one (with my approval) from another source. This review will be due on what would have been the final exam date for the course."

Formally, we look at the structure of how \"is true\" works linguistically, with the expressive power of such language, and with some fascinating logical issues that arise in the context of languages that can use such semantic vocabulary to talk about themselves.

    :description: "Course Goals & Description F. Ambrosio Spring 2005 228 New North 687-7441 Existentialism This course will be concerned with the question of human freedom; that question primarily involves asking what \"human freedom\" means and secondarily \"whether\" or how human persons are, or can be, free. The investigation of this question will be guided by the philosophical testimony of three major Existentialist philosophers - Nietzsche, Sartre, and Heidegger, in conversation with other philosophers who have written in the existentialist spirit: Kierkegaard, Dostoyevski, Camus, de Beauvoir, Weil. Our investigation of the question of freedom will take the form of a personal reflection on both the historical and the uniquely contemporary significance of a series of tensions that characterize human existence in the 21st century: The individuality of experience/the universality of reason; the objectivity of truth/the subjectivity of meaning; the limitations of human finitude/the desire for transcendence; personal fulfillment/social and moral responsibility; autonomy/relationship. Heidegger and Sartre experienced these issues in the historical situation of the first half of the 20th century; we experience them in the changed context of the beginning of a new millenium. This is a course in philosophy, not about philosophy. Our task is to make the question of human freedom our own, guided by whatever we can learn from the existentialist philosophers. This task requires that we reflect on our own experience of the problematic tensions that the Existentialists emphasized and that made Existentialism the important episode it was in the history of philosophy and culture. The benefit of such a reflection on our parts will not be primarily knowledge about that episode; rather, it will be an understanding ofwhat the question of human freedom means for us as persons in the time that is uniquely our own.

  - :name: "Philosophy and Psychoanalysis: Language"
    :number: "401"
    :description: "Course Goals & Description In this course we will concentrate on understanding the function of language in human beings. We will study the problem of language in the psychoanalytic tradition (mainly but not exclusively Freud and Lacan), in child development, in understanding and treating mentally ill persons, and in a couple of philosophers. We will start the course by analyzing closely and critically a number of texts by S. Freud. Freud, an accomplished neurologist, noticed early in his career that the symptoms of hysterics contradicted the known neurophysiology. Freud then asked the question as to what law the symptoms of the hysterics followed. His tentative and revolutionary answer was: the law of words. Lacan proposes a reading of Freud which pays close attention to this revolutionary claim. Lacan consults the anthropologist L\xC3\xA9vi-Straus to further document the efficacy of words and the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure to study the mechanisms by which speech reaches its efficacy. We will claim that the American philosopher Peirce possesses a theory of language that can explain even more of Freud\xE2\x80\x99s theory and practice of psychoanalysis. We will read Freud\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of the dream of Irma and see that Freud demonstrates that dreams have a manifest meaning and a latent meaning. To discover the latent meaning of the dream Freud recommends abandoning global interpretations in favor of following the chain of thought hidden in the details of the text. I will demonstrate that this Freudian technique is similar to the technique used in biblical scholarship in order to make sense of seemingly nonsensical stories in the bible such as the story of the ten bridesmaids. We then will return to Freud to see how he uses that technique to analyze two unusual phenomena in everyday life: mis-speech and jokes. The Freudian insights are conceptualized in Lacan\xE2\x80\x99s study on the function of the letter in the unconscious. This Lacanian conceptualization of Freudian insights allows new forms of therapeutic techniques such as the systematic search for ambiguities in the words of the patient. (In response to a patient stopping his reports by the expression \xE2\x80\x9CO well...\xE2\x80\x9D the therapist asked: \xE2\x80\x9Ctell me about the well\xE2\x80\x9D. That intervention allowed the uncovering of a profound trauma.) At the same time, the Freudian-Lacanian insights in mis-speech and jokes teach us that the double meaning of words and expressions is essential for the psychic life of human beings. We will also read Freud\xE2\x80\x99s and Lacan\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation of the \xE2\x80\x9CMemoirs of Judge Schreber.\xE2\x80\x9D Lacan agrees with Freud\xE2\x80\x99s claim that the hallucinations and deliriums of mentally ill patients are creative attempts to deal with unsolvable paradoxes in their lives. Using Freud but going substantially beyond Freud, Lacan will demonstrate that Judge Schreber and all schizophrenics have a defective relation to language. Two well know facts are the basis of Lacan\xE2\x80\x99s claim. Schizophrenics sometimes interpret linguistic expressions literally. Asked why she was crying, a patient told her therapist that she had no hands. To the further question as to why she thought that to be the case, she replied that her father had told her so that morning. He had said to her that \xE2\x80\x9Cshe was handicapped.\xE2\x80\x9D Schizophrenics also have difficulties to use pronouns. To the question if their parents liked them they might reply \xE2\x80\x9CNo, I did not like them.\xE2\x80\x9D We will finish the course by pointing out that the increased ability to use language goes hand in hand with an enrichment of the human personality. To do so, we will show the connection between Winnicott\xE2\x80\x99s concept of \xE2\x80\x98transitional object\xE2\x80\x9D and Freud\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of his grandchild playing with a spool. But when the grandchild loses its toy it makes use of language in order to overcome its fear of its mother going away. Language is thus not just an instrument of information; it is also an instrument for making a person emotionally independent. Texts & Readings Lacan: Ecrits. A Selection. Norton.

Assignments & Expectations of Students The course will be conducted as a seminar. All students are expected to have done the reading for the class. In addition, for each class, some students will be asked to either summarize the reading, choose some significant texts worthy of special attention, and/or formulate some questions worthy of class-discussion. I put a premium on the class understanding the concepts and thus I might allow the discussion of some texts to take longer than the time assigned in the syllabus. If the discussion touches upon problems that are discussed later in the semester, I might, exceptionally, re-arrange the order of discussion of the topics so as to accommodate the class discussion."

Is the difference between past, present and future absolute, and if so, then why does contemporary science not talk about this difference, or is it merely an artifact of our limited perspective? Can one travel backwards--or forwards--in time? How can the very same statement be true at one time and yet false at another? Does the future exist, and if so, does it follow that we are not architects of the future and hence have no freedom of will? What is the difference between "earlier" and "later" or between "past" and "future"? Why is it better to have pleasure ahead of one and pain behind one rather than the other way around? Could an all-knowing God exist outside of time?

Ambrosio Spring 2005 228 New North 687-7441 Existentialism This course will be concerned with the question of human freedom; that question primarily involves asking what \"human freedom\" means and secondarily \"whether\" or how human persons are, or can be, free. The investigation of this question will be guided by the philosophical testimony of three major Existentialist philosophers - Nietzsche, Sartre, and Heidegger, in conversation with other philosophers who have written in the existentialist spirit: Kierkegaard, Dostoyevski, Camus, de Beauvoir, Weil. Our investigation of the question of freedom will take the form of a personal reflection on both the historical and the uniquely contemporary significance of a series of tensions that characterize human existence in the 21st century: The individuality of experience/the universality of reason; the objectivity of truth/the subjectivity of meaning; the limitations of human finitude/the desire for transcendence; personal fulfillment/social and moral responsibility; autonomy/relationship. Heidegger and Sartre experienced these issues in the historical situation of the first half of the 20th century; we experience them in the changed context of the beginning of a new millenium. This is a course in philosophy, not about philosophy. Our task is to make the question of human freedom our own, guided by whatever we can learn from the existentialist philosophers. This task requires that we reflect on our own experience of the problematic tensions that the Existentialists emphasized and that made Existentialism the important episode it was in the history of philosophy and culture. The benefit of such a reflection on our parts will not be primarily knowledge about that episode; rather, it will be an understanding ofwhat the question of human freedom means for us as persons in the time that is uniquely our own.

  - :name: William of Ockham
    :number: "701"
    :description: "In his novel The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco models his hero, William of Baskerville, after William of Ockham, for he is a figure in the history of philosophy who moved the focus of knowing from that on abstract essences to the empirical individual available to our senses. What better figure for a detective who begins with singular, contingent facts in solving a series of murders in a monastery. But the reality behind the legend has only recently come to light, since we now have all the philosophical works of Ockham finally available in good critical editions with reliable texts. We are in a better position than ever before to assess his contributions to the change in thinking about (i) what types of things exist and (ii) what knowledge is, what its object is and its limits. In this course, then, we will investigate William of Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s contributions to metaphysics and epistemology. In metaphysics, we will examine the problem of the ontological status of universals. And as an introduction to this question, we will read two essays by Michael Loux on the contemporary debate over universals, one on metaphysical realism (as defended for example by B. Russell, R. Chisholm and D. Armstrong) and the second on nominalism (as defended for example by W.V. Quine, H.H. Price and D.C. Williams). With a clear view of the problem and of the main solutions/options, we will be in a position to understand Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s attempted reductionist ontological program and his view that \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversals are not things other than names\xE2\x80\x9D. In the second part of the course, we will look at Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s epistemology, both his conceptual empiricism and direct realism, along with Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s views on certainty and scepticism. The main text will be William Ockham (Notre Dame University Press, 1987, two volumes) by Marilyn McCord Adams, a landmark book, the first and best full-length study of Ockham based on the critical edition. But we will begin the course with Michael J. Loux\xE2\x80\x99s Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction, second edition, 2002, chapters one and two dealing with universals. Translations of Ockham on universals are to be found in Five Texts on the Medieval Problem of Universals, (Hackett, 1994) translated and edited by Paul Vincent Spade. You can buy all the texts on the web. Any other translated texts will be photocopied. The writings of William of Ockham are remarkably clear and challenging, like the best of analytic philosophy today. Once a number of technical terms are explained, students will be able to see how Ockham must confront the same or similar problems that face anyone who adopts one of various contemporary forms of nominalism."

Each year that it is offered, the seminar will focus intensively on a different topic of interest to students of participating departments. This is the third year the seminar will be offered. This year\xE2\x80\x99s topic is Law, Mind, and Brain, with a special focus on the role of intention and other mental states in moral and legal reasoning. The seminar will be taught under the supervision of Professor Henry Richardson (philosophy) and Professor John Mikhail (law), but faculty also will include distinguished scholars from other departments in the University and from institutions throughout the United States, who will guest-teach individual classes. These scholars will include experts in empirical ethics and cognitive science (Amanda Woodward, Joshua Greene, Joshua Knobe), legal philosophers (Arthur Ripstein, Larry Solan, Claire Finkelstein, John Ferejohn), and philosophers working in ethics and the philosophy of mind (Michael Bratman, Frances Kamm, Maggie Little, Mark Murphy) . The aim of the seminar is to introduce students to recent work on intention, mens rea, scienter, and related topics from a range of philosophical, psychological, and legal perspectives. Among other things, we will examine a variety of legal contexts (criminal law, statutory interpretation, constitutional analysis, etc.) in which intention, foreseeability, distinctions between means and ends, and similar concepts play an important role. The seminar will fulfill the Law Center\xE2\x80\x99s writing requirement, with the final paper due at the end of Spring Semester. Texts & Readings For the first meeting of the seminar, students will be asked to read selections from G. E. M. Anscombe's *Intention*. Thereafter, readings will be set by the visiting speakers."

    :description: "This seminar serves as an introduction to the Program in Social and Political Thought. The central purpose of the seminar is to examine and evaluate modern scholars\xE2\x80\x99 efforts to study human beings scientifically. Achieving this purpose will require (1) that we gain a clear understanding of what scientific inquiry is, (2) that we consider what must be true about human beings, as both agents and inquirers, if we are to conclude that the scientific method is the most appropriate way to study human affairs, and (3) that we ask how the scientific study of human affairs furthers and/or hinders our efforts to make sense of our experience as human beings. The course is organized chronologically. Because the leaders of the seventeenth century scientific revolution rebelled self-consciously against the Aristotelian mode of thinking, we will begin by trying to understand how Aristotle thought. After considering several key philosophical issues that lay beneath the scientific revolution, the remainder of the semester will be devoted to examining the writings of four influential social scientists: Adam Smith, William James, Max Weber, and Franz Boas. Critical analysis of these authors\xE2\x80\x99 work will help us grasp the defining preoccupations of the various social scientific disciplines, assess whether practicing social scientists in fact accomplish that to which they aspire, and consider what has been gained and lost in moving the study of human affairs beyond Aristotle."

Traditional Catholic philosophical ethics is a \"natural law ethics\" whose historical sources can be traced to Plato, Aristotle, and the Stoics, and which was synthesized and clarified in the 13th century by Thomas Aquinas. However, secular philosophers widely ignore or reject natural law ethics, and some present-day Roman Catholic ethicists regard traditional, Catholic, natural law ethics as promising too much and delivering too little. Moreover, current discussion of difficult moral issues, such as abortion, birth control, in vitro fertilization and transfer of embryos, surrogate motherhood, cloning, non-marital heterosexual or homosexual sexual activity, and homosexual marriage, poses many philosophical challenges to traditional Roman Catholic philosophical ethics. What, then, can a contemporary Roman Catholic natural law ethics say in response? In particular, we shall look sympathetically but critically at the philosophical answers of two important Roman Catholic authors, Germain Grisez and John Finnis. Spring."

Next, we will discuss various theoretical and practical problems that arise for the attribution of responsibility to collectives: When is it justifiable to hold a collective morally responsible, given that it is not a bearer of a free will? How is such responsibility distributed to individual members of the collective, if at all? How should members of a collective understand their individual responsibility as such a member? How should we understand the forward-looking dimensions of collective responsibility? Finally, we will focus on the special problem of collective responsibility in the liberal state, and explore the question of political responsibility with respect to collective problems such as environmental degradation, economic and social oppression, and gender and race discrimination."

In this course, we will explore these questions and a sampling of historical and contemporary answers to these questions. We will begin with the intuition that emotions are intimately related to how we value things and other people. From this intuition, we will explore how this relationship to valuing sets emotions up as central constituents of our moral life. Once we have explored this intuition, we will critically examine two historical conceptions of the place that emotions play in moral judgment, namely, Aristotle's moral theory and the moral theory of Immanuel Kant. Aristotle views emotions as central to our moral lives, while Kant tends to view emotions as unfortunate but unavoidable hindrances to morality. Throughout, we will concern ourselves with the nature of the relationship between the emotions and rationality.

Each student enrolled will be involved in a community-based learning project (see below); the study of course materials will be structured in significant ways around students\xE2\x80\x99 work and learning outside the classroom. The hope is that students\xE2\x80\x99 experiences in community-based learning projects will bring them into intimate and vital contact with central themes of the course, breathing life into the issues and questions we explore through readings and discussion. Course Themes and Questions How are we to understand the nature of responsible human agency and self-respect? To what extent are we, as individuals, justly held accountable for our life prospects and our choices, our actions and character traits \xE2\x80\x93 our capacity to flourish? How are these issues, in turn, at stake in mental health and wellness as they affect all of us? Addressing such puzzles is no simple task, especially if we realistically acknowledge our vulnerability as human beings to good and bad fortune in the \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Csocial\xE2\x80\x9D lotteries of life. Our exploration of these puzzles will be organized around three basic questions: (1) What conditions, if any, diminish, obstruct, or challenge our effectiveness and responsibility as individual agents? (2) How, if at all, can experiences of trauma, sustained stress, or the denigrating, dismissive attitudes of others impact our sense of dignity and self-respect? (3) What are important sources and forms of human resilience that, given the twists and turns of life, are key to human flourishing? We will examine these questions through the critical exploration of a range of topics: the nature of autonomy and its relation to human flourishing; the specter of \xE2\x80\x9Cmoral luck;\xE2\x80\x9D the proper scope of praise and blame; traumatic experience and its impact on the self; human resilience and its forms and sources; and emotions and attitudes of self-assessment (shame, remorse, guilt, integrity, and self-respect). Community-based learning With the help of the Center for Social Justice, a cluster of community-based learning opportunities well-suited to our course of study will be highlighted at the outset of the course. By the second week of class, students will, in close consultation with the instructor, commit to one of the programs. Programs with which Georgetown already has structured arrangements and transportation will be emphasized (e.g., DC Reads, Prison Outreach, ASK, HOPE). With permission of the instructor, students can also choose to continue work in programs with which they are already engaged. Course requirements: 1. At least 30 hours working with the chosen agency or program in the community. 2. An ongoing reflection journal linking course themes and community-based learning experience. The journal will be collected three times during the semester and will count toward final grade. Questions guiding journal reflections will be provided. 3. Three reflection essays in response to specific \xE2\x80\x9Cprompts\xE2\x80\x9D. One will follow a presentation of a guest speaker (to be arranged). 4. Class presentation of community-based learning experience as it relates to course themes. (This may be a team presentation, if a \xE2\x80\x9Cteam\xE2\x80\x9D of students is working together at one site.) 5. A formal final essay for the course in which students will invoke their community-based experiences as sources of insight and guidance in working closely with the philosophical themes and questions we have examined throughout the semester. 6. Grades will reflect attendance, class participation, improvement and backsliding. All assignments must be completed in order to pass the course. *Students will be invited to participate in on-going Blackboard discussion of course themes and community experiences with fellow students and the instructor.* Texts: Alex Kotlowitz, There Are No Children Here All other readings will be available on electronic reserve (and in hard copy) through Lauinger Library and the Bioethics Library (Healy)."

  - :name: Pragmatism and American Thought
    :number: "161"
    :description: "America is sometimes described as a land without philosophy, as when Alexis de Tocqueville wrote, \"I think that in no country in the civilized world is less attention paid to philosophy than in the United States. The Americans have no philosophical school of their own, and they care but little for all the schools into which Europe is divided, the very names of which are scarcely known to them.\" We have produced no Plato, Descartes, or Kant. America is the birthplace, however, of pragmatism. Indeed, pragmatism has often been thought to capture distinctively American attitudes: a preference for practical success over principled stances; a materialist approach to life; an instinct for the bottom line. Thus, it comes as no surprise to read William James declare that in order to choose between competing philosophies, we must spell them out in terms of their \"cash-value.\" Pragmatism is something of an anti-philosophy, at least if Plato, Descartes, and Kant are our models of philosophers. Consonant with these \"pragmatist\" stances, American legal realists declare that legal \"rules are important so far as they help you to predict what judges will do. That is all their importance except as pretty playthings\" (Karl Llewellyn) and \"a legal duty so called is nothing but a prediction that if a man does or omits certain things he will be made to suffer in this or that way by judgment of the court; \xE2\x80\x94and so of a legal right\" (Justice Holmes). In the context of political philosophy, John Dewey argues that an uncompromising commitment to the Bill of Rights represents an \"idolatry of the Constitution,\" rather than a pragmatic concern for balancing powers and prerogatives so as to produce the best overall result. In this course we will examine American Legal Realism and Dewey's vision of participatory democracy in depth. We will locate and develop the philosophical underpinnings of these expressions of pragmatism, and we will challenge them both with respect to their philosophical foundations and their practical effects."

    :number: "185"
    :description: "PHIL 185: Agency and Identity \xE2\x80\x93 The plan of the course is to study two major philosophical issues that arise when we consider human nature. The first is the problem of free will and moral responsibility. Philosophers have long considered there to be many potential threats to the notion that human beings act freely, and they've continually argued over whether our practice of holding one another morally accountable for our actions is justified in light of these threats. In order to understand these issues we have to consider metaphysical questions about whether our world is causally determined, and what, if anything, this implies about the possibility of responsible agency. The second issue is the problem of personal identity. Here the question that arises is: what makes someone the same person over time? In order to answer this we first have to know what human persons are, and coming to understand this involves getting clear about the relation between the mind and the body. When we combine this view of the nature of persons with an account of the general criteria for the persistence of an object through time we can begin to make progress. In the end, the aim of the course is to challenge students to arrive at a better understanding of their nature as human persons."

Also, we will consider arguments from design \xE2\x80\x93 given the obvious complexity, beauty, and coordination of the physical world, it must follow that some rational being planned and constructed the physical universe. In part two of the course, we consider the so-called \"problem of evil\". There is obviously horrific suffering occurring in the world. How can such suffering be compatible with the existence of a benevolent and omnipotent God? Finally, we shall discuss the rationality and intelligibility of religious belief. It is a common belief among intellectuals that traditional Christian theism is unreasonable. One of the sources for this conviction is the suggestion that there is insufficient evidence for theism. In this course, we will examine the ramifications and limits of the lack of evidence to support standard Judeo-Christian accounts of God."

Must one have a reason? How we answer these questions seems as thought it will influence the kinds of explanation we are likely to accept of any particular action. What counts as a good explanation of an action? Is explaining an action like explaining the falling of an apple from a tree? As we wonder about what actions are and how to explain them, we might also wonder how much of a difference we ever really make in the world. Do we ever do anything more than move our bodies? How could we be responsible for more than that? This course is an introduction to philosophizing about action by way of a consideration of these issues."

In this course, we will consider three of the most influential theories in contemporary normative ethics: Aristotelian virtue ethics, Kantianism, and utilitarianism. Within that structure, many of the particular topics and themes will be chosen by the students in the seminar. In each section of the course, we will study the historical source for the theory and then consider how that theory has been developed and applied in contemporary ethics. Once we have completed our discussion of the primary historical source, students will decide as a group which themes and issues they want to pursue in the contemporary literature, and I will find appropriate readings. Possible contemporary themes include moral education, luck and happiness, the moral significance of emotions, the possibility of moral reform, anti-moralism and individual conscience, respect and contempt, moral integrity, the role of morality in personal relationships, and moral obligations to distant others and/or future generations."

We will spend more time on Leibniz than on Spinoza, but Leibniz will help us into the difficult texts of Spinoza. The focus will be on their metaphysical accounts of the world: substance, explanation, causation, God, the human being. We will also examine the views of Leibniz and Spinoza on modality (what is and what is not possible) and Spinoza's epistemology, with its bold and encouraging claim that in some sense one cannot make mistakes. The aim is to understand central ideas in the thought of Leibniz and Spinoza, as well as to consider their relevance to contemporary thought. The usual method by which I teach courses like this is that I become a 21st century version of the historical figure, defending and extending the figure's philosophical views, while students probe for weaknesses in the edifice.

  - :name: History of the Philosophy of Law
    :number: "474"
    :description: "The aim of this seminar is to examine two centrally defining themes that have dominated the development of western legal theory from its inception. Sources of law. The first theme is found within the perennial debate over the sources of law. The question is, What counts as law, such that judges and citizens alike can consult it in order to determine their legal obligations, as opposed, for example, to what is required merely by morality, decency, social custom, true religion, familial expectation or professional norms? The simplified account of this debate contrasts the claims of legal positivism and natural law. Legal positivists claim that the source of binding law is limited to positive law, such as legislative and constitutional enactments. They are merely conventions recognized and enforced by a political jurisdiction. Judge-made law found in judicial decisions might also be counted as a source of law by positivists, but the history of common law theory shows that the standard philosophical contrast does not capture the full spectrum of theoretical positions. Some common law theorists claim that the written decisions of judges are but \xE2\x80\x9Cevidence of the law,\xE2\x80\x9D and that the actual source of that law resides elsewhere. Some suggest that behind the written expression of common law is some higher law, as natural law theorists maintain, or, as some English common law theorists and earlier Roman law theorists maintained, its source of authority resides in a universal, extra-legal conception of reasonableness. For others, the source of judge-made law is to be found in some notion of reasonableness internal to the law, such that there is an unwritten law that involves neither natural law nor any other extra-legal standards of reasonableness. Possible sources of unwritten law internal to, but not a part of, the positive expressions of common law include the customary expectations and wisdom of a people, or the \xE2\x80\x9Cancient constitution\xE2\x80\x9D which judges discover with the aid of \xE2\x80\x9Cartificial reason\xE2\x80\x9D bequeathed from \xE2\x80\x9Ctime immemorial.\xE2\x80\x9D Whether such views can be accommodated within a legal positivist framework or rendered compatible with the central tenets of natural law are open questions. The purpose of law. The purpose or function of the law has been a constant theme from the earliest recorded discussions we have available. Candidates suggested within Plato\xE2\x80\x99s dialogues alone range from the most cynical to the most romantic. Law is claimed by some to be the coercive rule of the stronger designed to preserve their privileges and powers over the weak. Others argue that law is the mechanism by which the more numerous, weak and less meritorious segments of society prevent the minority of the strong and deserving from getting what they are due. Still others argue that the sole or primary purpose of the law, if not corrupted, is the preservation of social cohesion, the protection of the vulnerable from exploitation and injury by the powerful, the creation of conditions necessary for the development of individual excellence, the creation of a framework within which individuals can pursue their own interests with minimal interference from others (including the state), the maintenance and transmission of a common moral culture, maintaining civil peace, or establishing a common framework of social cooperation such that individuals can rely upon and be held accountable for meeting standards of conduct that reflect their settled, mutual expectations, and so on. How legal theory answers questions about the purpose of law lies at the heart of many differences in theories of how judges such interpret the laws. Whole theories of legal interpretation turn on claims that judges have a duty to decide each case, not in isolation, but as part of a coherent account of the underlying purposes of the law. For the more skeptical-minded theorists, showing that the true purposes are either numerous and conflicting, or less noble than generally advertised in high school civics classes and supreme court confirmation hearings, reveals the inherent poverty of theory in law."

    :description: "Even after his recent death, Jacques Derrida arguably remains the most influential voice in contemporary European cultural discourse. Although his name is widely and, in some circles notoriously, associated with \xE2\x80\x9CDeconstruction\xE2\x80\x9D and more generically with \xE2\x80\x9CPostmodernism,\xE2\x80\x9D the difficulty of his texts has meant that those who have actually read his texts have been relatively few, and even among these it has taken time for the profile of Derrida\xE2\x80\x99s literary identity to become recognizable. In the first half of his career, almost no one knew what to make of him, except that he was exciting and strange; in the second stage of his life, a type of \xE2\x80\x9Cseriousness\xE2\x80\x9D emerged that , although still unique and distinctive, forced readers to reconsider what Deridda might be asking of them.

Rather, it will attempt to assist students to make a modest beginning in reading Derrida\xE2\x80\x99s texts for themselves. Certain representative works will be read to gain familiarity with the deconstructive style of reading and thinking. Then attention will turn to some of the dominant themes in his later texts, especially those which would traditionally be considered religious, ethical and political concerns. Therefore, since the course is practical in aim, it will be conducted, as far as possible, in seminar style; students should be prepared to participate actively, based on a careful reading of the texts.

The first half of the seminar will begin with some classic writings (Stalnaker, Grice, Kaplan) and then turn to recent debates (e.g., Stanley & Szabo, Travis, Cappelen & Lepore, Recanati). In the second half, we'll examine the significance of these debates to other questions in philosophy. The specific topics will be determined in consultation with students, but could include, for example: the context-sensitivity of moral terms, contextual approaches to vagueness, contextual approaches to metaphor, compositionality, accommodating context in inferentialist approaches to semantics, radical contextualism and the alleged incoherence of metaphysical realism, etc."

    :description: "Phil. 518-01: GENDER AND EQUALITY Alisa Carse F 10:45-1:15, NN 204 Course Description Many of us agree that few facts about us are as powerful and significant for questions of identity, self-understanding, and life prospects as our gender. Yet what sort of \"fact\" is the fact of one's gender? What differences mark women and men as female and male, and how fixed and universal are these differences? Are gender differences natural, social, or cultural in their origin? Are they all three? How does the significance of gender intersect with other facts about us, such as our sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious heritage, level of education, or socioeconomic status? On these questions, we find deep and significant disagreement and debate. In this course we will bring a philosophic lens to difficult questions about gender and its significance for social and political equality. We will examine a variety of (sometimes conflicting) interpretations and explanations of gender difference, as well as a range of theories analyzing gender subordination. Among the topics we will address are the following: images and norms of masculinity and femininity; conceptions of \xE2\x80\x9Cequality,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Coppression,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Csubordination,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cprivilege;\xE2\x80\x9D the problem of androcentrism; gender and the politics of appearance; gender and shame; gender and sexuality; sexuality and violence; conceptions of \xE2\x80\x9Cliberation.\xE2\x80\x9D Close attention will be given to differences within \xE2\x80\x9Cfeminist\xE2\x80\x9D thought and other theoretical orientations as they bear on these and other issues.

  - :name: Topics in Political Philosophy
    :number: "519"
    :description: "Course Goals & Description This graduate seminar will treat four connected topics in political philosophy: authority, republicanism and non-domination, recognition, and nationality. While the discussion of each topic will be anchored in a classic text, most of our attention will be devoted to interesting and influential recent work in political philosophy. Indeed, the topics were chosen largely with an eye to affording an excuse to read some of the most exciting recent work in the subject. Authority. The question of the state\xE2\x80\x99s legitimate authority, and of citizens\xE2\x80\x99 consequent or concomitant duty to obey, is fundamental. Hobbes\xE2\x80\x99s Leviathan centers on this problem and propounds a controversial answer. We will read selections from Leviathan as well as David Hume\xE2\x80\x99s classic critique of such social-contract views in \xE2\x80\x9COf the Original Contract.\xE2\x80\x9D Joseph Raz\xE2\x80\x99s Morality of Freedom (1986) propounds quite a different answer to the problem of authority. In recent times, the work of A. John Simmons has shifted the burden of proof onto those who would argue for a duty to obey the state. We will read the just-published debate between Simmons and Christopher Wellman on the subject. Republicanism and Non-domination. These debates pit authority against individual freedom. Consequently, much hinges on how freedom is conceived. Philip Pettit\xE2\x80\x99s Republicanism has powerfully argued for conceiving of political freedom, not as the absence of interference, but as the absence of domination. In so doing, Pettit take himself to be reviving the tradition of ancient Roman republicanism. Before proceeding to Pettit\xE2\x80\x99s book, we will acquaint ourselves with that tradition by reading selections from Machiavelli\xE2\x80\x99s earlier attempt at reviving it in his Discourses on the First Ten Books of Livy. Recognition. Contemporary interest in multiculturalism and the politics of identity has revived interest in Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s idea that politics is, above all, a struggle for recognition. After reading the famous, relevant sections from Hegel\xE2\x80\x99s Phenomenology, we will turn to two recent works that make the idea central in political philosophy: Axel Honneth\xE2\x80\x99s Struggle for Recognition (1996) and Patchen Markell\xE2\x80\x99s Bound for Recognition (2003). Nationality. The struggle for recognition sets up centripetal tendencies that threaten to undermine the normative importance of the nation-state. Is that a bad thing? Do we owe special duties to our fellow-citizens? And if we desire to separate from them, what right do we have to secede? Allan Buchanan\xE2\x80\x99s book on Secession is the closest thing to a \xE2\x80\x9Cclassic\xE2\x80\x9D work on that topic. The special claims of nationality are questioned in Martha Nussbaum, et al., For Love of Country? and are defended in David Miller\xE2\x80\x99s On Nationality.

Among the specific issues we shall consider are these: the classical pragmatist verificationist theory of meaning (in Peirce, James, and the middle Dewey); classical pragmatist attempts to formulate verificationist theories of truth; Dewey's conception of warranted assertibility; whether such verificationist theories of truth are inherently relativist; Putnam's attempt to update the account of and motivation for a kind of ideal verificationism; and Rorty's rejection altogether of theories of truth and epistemology (and what the heck!, Western philosophy) ."

    :number: "775"
    :description: Though often regarded as philosophical and political opposites, John Stuart Mill and Friedrich Nietzsche are connected in a remarkable number of interesting ways. Writing at the end of the nineteenth century, they confront, in manifestly different fashions, the implications of democratizing politics and mass culture. Both appreciate the power and the dangers of philosophies of history. Both endorse projects of creative self affirmation. And both confront questions of equality and inequality and examine the relationship between politics and culture. Recently, Richard Rorty has suggested that a judicious reconciliation of Mill and Nietzsche can provide the basis for a healthy postmodern society. Consequently, there are a great number of reasons to consider these thinkers together. This course will focus on some of the major works of both thinkers. The focus will be on the interpretation and critique of these texts.

The vast majority of natural phenomena, as well as technology, can be understood, as opposed to quantified, by a description in words rather than equations. Given qualitative rather than quantitative discourse as the "language" of the course, the central focus of the course is to see science in everyday life. Most science courses first present the science, and then find applications for it. This course comes at it the other way around, first asking questions about familiar phenomena and devices. Examples are "Why is the sky blue at noon and red at sunset?" and "How does a xerox machine work?". Then the course works from there to the underlying science.

In this course, we will show how to systematically build a theory based on the fact that the speed of light is a constant in any inertial reference frame, which leads to time dilation, length contraction, and a number of surprising paradoxes. We will then note how Einstein's principle of equivalence leads to a reformulation of our understanding of gravity, namely general relativity. Next we will introduce the quantum-mechanical world and see how wave-particle duality leads to a probabilistic interpretation of physical reality. We will employ the two-slit experiment to understand the bizarre predictions of quantum mechanics.

    :number: "201"
    :description: "Political Economy and International Political Economy are fast growing fields of study that focus on the methodological and substantive intersection of economics and political science. This class emphasizes the methodological tools and techniques that underlie much of the current research in this field. These models and techniques allow us to structure our thinking about fundamental concepts regarding the nature of political and economic preferences, the problems of preference aggregation and the link between policy preferences and policy outcomes, problems of collective action, and strategic interaction. Mastering these tools and techniques is important for understanding the major works in the field and contributing to it. Students are expected to use these tools and techniques in courses throughout the PECO/IPEC majors to analyze substantive issues of the field (such as economic development, the politics of trade or finance, government-business relations, etc.). Most important, all students will be required to write a article-length research paper on a topic of their choosing during the spring of the senior year as part of PECO/IPEC401. In that paper, students are expected to apply the analytical techniques learned in this course and their statistics courses. Throughout the major, students are encouraged to keep a notebook of ideas and topics that they find interesting which could serve as the foundation of their PECO/IPEC401 paper. This course is team-taught by a political scientist and economist. Prerequisites: Microeconomic Theory (ECON-101) and one foundation government course. Note that ECON-101 has Microeconomic Principles (ECON-001) and Elementary Calculus (MATH-035) as prerequisites."

  - :name: Psychology, Photography, and the Visual Arts
    :number: "230"
    :description: "What is art? This question is explored in the context of photography. After a brief treatment of technical aspects of photography, both traditional principles of composition and the much richer system of visual design articulated by Freeman Patterson are explored in detail. The photographer is responsible for everything in the picture space. The slightest change may make a difference in how the viewer reacts to the photograph. The psychology of composition must be understood in order to increase the likelihood that viewers will react to the photograph the way the photographer wants them to react. Thus principles of visual perception, cognition, and emotion assume an important role. For example, the many cues that play a part in depth perception and factors that control eye moments are discussed at length. Also included are three sessions devoted to the psychology of motion pictures, especially cinematography, special effects, and stunt work. The course is designed to improve your photography as well as your appreciation of photographic art. Most people take pictures to record the many details of a wide variety of subjects. This subject-oriented approach is contrasted with a design-oriented approach which is much more compatible with the principles of psychology underlying visual composition. Of course, the design approach includes realistic photography but it also includes the creation of abstracts, the \xE2\x80\x9Cpoetry\xE2\x80\x9D of photography. Students will be required to create two portfolios of ten pictures each and will learn to make ordinary subjects extraordinary. Either digital or film cameras are acceptable. This course caters not only to students who are visually creative, but also to students who aspire to unlock the creativity they didn\xE2\x80\x99t know they had. Offered both semesters.

    :description: "Memory is characterized both by extraordinary powers and by puzzling limitations. Examples of these extremes can be seen in all of us; we recall details of events experienced in childhood, yet find ourselves unable to think of the single item for which we drove to the grocery store. Other extremes of memory are witnessed only in unusual individuals; mnemonists with apparently limitless photographic memories stand in sharp contrast to individuals who suffer from amnesia so severe that they have forgotten who they are. Everyday we keep track if our own autobiographies and our plans for the future. This course explores such powers and limitations, and considers critically what they reveal about the nature of human memory. Among the topics considered are mnemonists, techniques for improving memory, amnesia, the development and aging of memory in the individual, autobiographical memory and self, eye witness testimony, trauma, the effects of brain damage on memory. The course will be particularly focused on how memory is experienced in real world contexts. The course will also include sections on how memory and memory disorders are portrayed in the media and will require reviewing and critiquing popular books and movies (e.g. Memento (written by a GU alumnus).

Frequently, the criminal act is \"forced\" into an existing theory of behavior; sometimes the explanation \"explains\" the behavior, but often it fails to answer completely why the person so acted. Rather than attempting to fit criminal actions into an already existing explanation of human behavior, this course will examine various theories for those behaviors and search for additional reasons and explanations for those acts. Developmental issues will be specifically explored, as the class struggles to gain a fuller understanding of factors influencing behavior, including family, biological, social and environmental determinants. The course will also explore recent developments in criminal behavior, such as the proliferations of violence in today's society and current correctional treatment issues. Prerequisite: PSYC-001.

Are the symptoms we find in schizophrenia, mania, depression, obsession, and autistic disorders to be found among geniuses as well, or do \"symptoms\" in the minds of the genius take a different twist and turn? Regarding the origins of madness and genius, is genius bred in the bone (nature), or the result of the right sort of learning environment (nurture), or does genius seem to arise ex nihilo, as some monumental gift? And as to creativity itself and the psychological processes employed, where we find loose associations and overinclusive thinking, and fabulized combinations and figures fractionating into relativism if not autism, are these processes that have been observed in both madness and genius the same, or are there identifiable distinctions in the mode and manner of these creating minds themselves?

Such an awareness has led both researchers and clinicians to intensify their study of developmental disturbances among children and adolescents, and has given birth to a new field, developmental psychopathology. This course introduces students to this burgeoning new area of inquiry that focuses on the intersection of developmental and clinical psychology. The unique aspects of taking a developmental approach to understanding psychopathology will be emphasized. Among the topics to be considered are concepts of vulnerability and resilience, assessment and diagnosis of childhood disorders, and the manifestation in children and adolescents of depression, anxiety disorders, aggression, hyperactivity, schizophrenia, and eating disorders.

  - :name: The Roots, Growth, and Fruits of Cognitive Neuroscience
    :number: "373"
    :description: "ROOTS: The roots of cognitive science were nourished during the 19th Century. Anatomical and physiological experimentation resulted in the concept of an internal body environment that regulated itself. Relating brain autopsies to the behavior of the deceased individual gave credence to the idea that mental faculties are governed by distinguishable brain systems. Electrical stimulation of certain parts of the human brain\xE2\x80\x99s cortex produced movements and resulted in experienced sensations. Discrepancies between the course of electrical stimulation of nerves and the elicitation of reflexes led to the concept of the synapse: a junction between discontinuities in nerve cells. Sophisticated models relating brain function to behavior were developed: notably those of Ivan Pavlov, Sigmund Freud and William James. None of these contributions were extant at the end of the 18th century. GROWTH: The 20th Century was characterized by a tremendous growth of techniques to study the brain/behavior relationship. Attempts were made to create a science of psychology independent of brain research and independent of the verbal pronouncements describing a person\xE2\x80\x99s introspections. This led to a series of different but related \xE2\x80\x9Cbehaviorisms\xE2\x80\x9D. John Watson espoused the idea that recordings from muscles would \xE2\x80\x9Cgive away\xE2\x80\x9D what they were experiencing and thinking. Clark Hull developed an engineering \xE2\x80\x9CInput-output\xE2\x80\x9D, stimulus-response, approach centered on learning, from which intervening processes could be quantitatively derived. Hull aimed to give meaning of these intervening processes by referring to the work of Pavlov, Freud and Watson. Other forms of behaviorism were more direct. These forms of behaviorism also centered on the learning process, giving emphasis to the role of reward and punishment. The latest of these was the contribution of Burrhus (Fred) Skinner. Skinner labeled his form of behaviorism \xE2\x80\x9Cresponse-reinforcement\xE2\x80\x9D. These forms of behaviorism each had strengths and weaknesses. As my research was contemporaneous with that of the behaviorists and, as a technical behaviorist, I occasionally collaborated and often had enjoyably critical encounters with them, the course will consist of a 21st century evaluation of the behaviorists contribution. While behaviorism enveloped psychology, the techniques by which the brain could be studied matured. Neuroanatomy was enriched by the development of new techniques that could select out tracts in the nervous system on the basis of their chemistry. Neurosurgical micro-techniques were refined for applications in humans and brought to bear in animal experiments. (Pavlov in 1924 had complained that none of his brain operated dogs had survived: they had died either of epilepsy of brain abscess.) Electrical recordings (EEGs) could be made from the brain through the scalp. And fine wire and glass tubing electrodes were developed to allow recordings from single or small groups of brain cells. Amplifiers, oscilloscopes and computers became available to record behavior and the electrical activity of the brain. All of this happened during my research career and made it possible to answer questions, answers that had, frustratingly, been beyond our reach. Finally, imaging techniques have most recently become available that allowed scientists to look at a normal human brain while the person is experiencing, attending, problem solving and thinking. In this course we need to become aware of pitfalls that need to be avoided in interpreting the results of theses imaging techniques, pitfalls that led to errors that befell the scientists at the beginning of the 19th century. Hopefully, current science can avoid and correct such errors before they become corrupting. FLOWERING: Now, at the dawn of the 21st century we are in a position to modify and go beyond the theories developed during the 19th century on the basis of the research accomplished in the 20th. Already much has been accomplished and some of the \xE2\x80\x9Chot\xE2\x80\x9D topics under current discussion will top off the course. Course requirements: Every 2-3 weeks, students will be asked to write short essays about what they have learned. These will be take home, open book exercises. Collaboration between students is encouraged; but each essay must be forged and written by the student himself. No one knows what he or she knows until they have seen it in communicable form."

    :description: "Vision: From neuronal mechanisms to behavior and back Synopsis Humans are visual animals: Over 50% of cortex is devoted to visual tasks (making it possible to, for instance, read the words on this page). While vision appears effortless, a closer examination of the steps necessary to go from the outside world to a focused picture on the retina, to a representation of this picture in the form of activations of millions of fibers in the optic nerve, to the percept of, e.g., \xE2\x80\x9Dmy friend Jack, smiling\xE2\x80\x9D (and to do so despite large possible variations, e.g., of the position, scale, viewpoint, illumination, and facial expression of Jack\xE2\x80\x99s face), shows that vision is a very complicated process for which the brain has developed extremely effective solutions. Understanding the principles underlying information processing in vision is likely relevant also for other sensory systems and other aspects of cognition. This is a challenging task, however, because it requires several levels of understanding, from the computational level, over the level of cellular and biophysical mechanisms and the level of neuronal circuits, up to the level of behavior. This course will examine the neural bases of visual processing, motivated by the computational demands of vision in a complex natural world. Topics will range from contrast processing in the retina to the neural bases of reading and facial expression recognition, focusing on physiological and brain imaging studies of the mammalian visual system, behavioral studies of animals and humans, and neuropsychological data as well as ideas from machine vision, demonstrating how the integration of these techniques has been so successful in furthering our understanding of vision. We will also discuss parallels in sensory processing between vision and other sensory modalities (in particular audition).

    :description: "Course Goals & Description In this course we will concentrate on understanding the function of language in human beings. We will study the problem of language in the psychoanalytic tradition (mainly but not exclusively Freud and Lacan), in child development, in understanding and treating mentally ill persons, and in a couple of philosophers. We will start the course by analyzing closely and critically a number of texts by S. Freud. Freud, an accomplished neurologist, noticed early in his career that the symptoms of hysterics contradicted the known neurophysiology. Freud then asked the question as to what law the symptoms of the hysterics followed. His tentative and revolutionary answer was: the law of words. Lacan proposes a reading of Freud which pays close attention to this revolutionary claim. Lacan consults the anthropologist L\xC3\xA9vi-Straus to further document the efficacy of words and the linguist Ferdinand de Saussure to study the mechanisms by which speech reaches its efficacy. We will claim that the American philosopher Peirce possesses a theory of language that can explain even more of Freud\xE2\x80\x99s theory and practice of psychoanalysis. We will read Freud\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of the dream of Irma and see that Freud demonstrates that dreams have a manifest meaning and a latent meaning. To discover the latent meaning of the dream Freud recommends abandoning global interpretations in favor of following the chain of thought hidden in the details of the text. I will demonstrate that this Freudian technique is similar to the technique used in biblical scholarship in order to make sense of seemingly nonsensical stories in the bible such as the story of the ten bridesmaids. We then will return to Freud to see how he uses that technique to analyze two unusual phenomena in everyday life: mis-speech and jokes. The Freudian insights are conceptualized in Lacan\xE2\x80\x99s study on the function of the letter in the unconscious. This Lacanian conceptualization of Freudian insights allows new forms of therapeutic techniques such as the systematic search for ambiguities in the words of the patient. (In response to a patient stopping his reports by the expression \xE2\x80\x9CO well...\xE2\x80\x9D the therapist asked: \xE2\x80\x9Ctell me about the well\xE2\x80\x9D. That intervention allowed the uncovering of a profound trauma.) At the same time, the Freudian-Lacanian insights in mis-speech and jokes teach us that the double meaning of words and expressions is essential for the psychic life of human beings. We will also read Freud\xE2\x80\x99s and Lacan\xE2\x80\x99s interpretation of the \xE2\x80\x9CMemoirs of Judge Schreber.\xE2\x80\x9D Lacan agrees with Freud\xE2\x80\x99s claim that the hallucinations and deliriums of mentally ill patients are creative attempts to deal with unsolvable paradoxes in their lives. Using Freud but going substantially beyond Freud, Lacan will demonstrate that Judge Schreber and all schizophrenics have a defective relation to language. Two well know facts are the basis of Lacan\xE2\x80\x99s claim. Schizophrenics sometimes interpret linguistic expressions literally. Asked why she was crying, a patient told her therapist that she had no hands. To the further question as to why she thought that to be the case, she replied that her father had told her so that morning. He had said to her that \xE2\x80\x9Cshe was handicapped.\xE2\x80\x9D Schizophrenics also have difficulties to use pronouns. To the question if their parents liked them they might reply \xE2\x80\x9CNo, I did not like them.\xE2\x80\x9D We will finish the course by pointing out that the increased ability to use language goes hand in hand with an enrichment of the human personality. To do so, we will show the connection between Winnicott\xE2\x80\x99s concept of \xE2\x80\x98transitional object\xE2\x80\x9D and Freud\xE2\x80\x99s analysis of his grandchild playing with a spool. But when the grandchild loses its toy it makes use of language in order to overcome its fear of its mother going away. Language is thus not just an instrument of information; it is also an instrument for making a person emotionally independent. Texts & Readings Lacan: Ecrits. A Selection. Norton.

Assignments & Expectations of Students The course will be conducted as a seminar. All students are expected to have done the reading for the class. In addition, for each class, some students will be asked to either summarize the reading, choose some significant texts worthy of special attention, and/or formulate some questions worthy of class-discussion. I put a premium on the class understanding the concepts and thus I might allow the discussion of some texts to take longer than the time assigned in the syllabus. If the discussion touches upon problems that are discussed later in the semester, I might, exceptionally, re-arrange the order of discussion of the topics so as to accommodate the class discussion."

  - :name: INTRODUCTION TO NONPROFITS, NGOS & CIVIL SOCIETY
    :number: "530"
    :description: "By many different measures the nonprofit sector in the United States is substantial: the sector is made up of approximately 1.4 million organizations (over 800,000 of them registered 501(c)3's); its total expenditures of $930 billion (in 2003) are 8.5 percent of GDP; and it employs some 8 percent of the U.S. workforce. While enjoying explosive growth in the U.S., NGOs are playing an increasing role across national boundaries and in other countries. Over the past two decades the global growth of NGOs has been described by one scholar as nothing less than a \"civil society revolution.\" The functions of the sector, whether viewed domestically or internationally, are diverse: organizing basic and applied research; delivering social services and health care; providing for cultural activities; and engaging in public policy advocacy across a wide range of issues. This course will survey the sector and the various institutions \xE2\x80\x93 community-based organizations, advocacy groups, international NGOs, philanthropic foundations, and think tanks \xE2\x80\x93 of which it is comprised. The course will draw on various disciplines \xE2\x80\x93 history, political theory, economics, and sociology \xE2\x80\x93 to understand the evolution of the sector. It will explore the policy environment that shapes and limits the sector\xE2\x80\x99s opportunities and that seeks to hold it accountable to the public.

The course will require readings (roughly half a book per week) that explore the constitutional and regulatory structures that determine the character of this political relationship, the history and theories behind these structures, and present battles over media concentration and telecommunications infrastructure. Preparation and participation are required for this seminar. My goal is for the student to develop a clear understanding of how public policy shapes and is in turn shaped by the structure of communication at the local, state and national level. Two 10-15 page papers and a group project will determine the grade.

    :description: Few questions are more vexing or inherently controversial than the relationship of the media to politics and policy-making. There is even dispute over what constitutes "the media." This course is organized around particular problems raised in the debate and specific media institutions. Some of the problems given particular attention are the press' coverage of the 2008 presidential campaign, the ability of media institutions to police themselves and the role of journalists in political campaigns. Attention will also be paid to media innovations, including the increasing importance of the Web, the rise of the blogs, talk radio and National Public Radio, and the rise of media polling. Guests with particular expertise and experience have been invited to help lead sessions devoted to their areas of interest. The reading list includes popular and journalistic works - including the work of journalists who will meet with the class - as well as the work of scholars. Students will be encouraged to bring their own perspectives to bear, and are strongly urged to add to the reading list and to exchange readings with each other (and their instructor). Students will be required to produce one research paper (20 to 25 pages in length) touching on a problem of their choosing in the area of media and politics.

Participants will examine the constraints public managers face in a democratic society; how the challenges of public management vary across different organizational and policy settings; and how public management and policy analysis frequently intersect. A key objective is to offer students a useful mix of theoretical knowledge and practical skills. Throughout the course, emphasis is placed on management as a function performed in all sectors (public, nonprofit, and private) but, when appropriate, participants focus on what factors make public management distinctive and more challenging. Some of the specific topics covered include: executive leadership; the role of front-line operators and middle managers; organizational culture; problems of bureaucratic coordination and dysfunction; how Congress, the President, and the courts can influence the public bureaucracy; managing people; managing budgets; privatization and contracting out; ethics in public management; performance management and strategic planning; and management reform strategies.

We will focus on effective leadership strategies for analyzing and diagnosing public problems and needs; for implementing creative and responsible solutions through policies or program delivery; and for mobilizing resources and support across organizations and sectors. Students will be challenged to think critically about the moral responsibilities and ethical dilemmas of public leadership; to understand the competing demands on leaders trying to accommodate politics, institutional constraints, and the multiple agendas of interested parties; to examine their own capacity for leadership; and to discover new ways to think about and exercise leadership for the public good. We will explore leadership principles and practices in a variety of ways: analysis of the current political scene, key actors, and forces influencing leadership decisions; case studies of leaders in action, from issue advocates to presidents; class discussions with experienced public leaders and the journalists who cover them; and participation in class activities designed to allow students to practice their leadership skills. Students also will have an opportunity to interview two leaders of their choice to learn about the issues they face, the strategies they use, and the advice they offer to emerging public leaders."

The course explores the environmental policy process in four stages. The first section studies the means by which the public and interests attempt to communicate their environmental policy goals to policy-makers. The second element assesses how the four major institutions in the U.S. government engage in environmental policy and politics. The third part deals with the changing shape of environmental politics and policy \xE2\x80\x93 in terms of federalism and innovations in environmental management. Finally the course concludes by assessing how each of these three elements influences the politics of, and policy-making surrounding environmental justice.

    :description: This module is designed to provide students with an understanding of international labor standards, specifically child labor, forced labor, employment discrimination and freedom of association and collective bargaining. For example, wanting ILS in trade agreements is a political issue, while wanting developing countries to implement them is a development issue. With increased international economic interdependence over the past half century, conditions in the workplace and treatment of workers have become more global. Globalization has become more contentious and raised a number of economic issues to the forefront for policymakers to consider. For example, anti-globalization and other demonstrations at high-level international meetings are becoming more commonplace. Expanded open trade has increased the size of the world economic pie; however, how this pie is being sliced up remains an issue.

    :number: "730"
    :description: Economic analysis is widely used in various public policy fields such as environmental policy, industrial organization, social welfare, and labor market. Economic principles of consumer and producer theory, social welfare economics, public goods and externality, market failure, market structure, imperfect information, business cycle, monetary and fiscal policy, and economic growth offer many insights into understanding of economics in deriving solutions to the issues of public policy. These economic principles and some quantitative methods will be studied in detail to understand the application of economic theories and quantitative models to public policy analysis. The course will provide students with the concepts and tools of economics to analyze the role of government intervention, its justification, and implications for efficiency and fairness, using specific policy areas as examples.

It should strengthen your decision making ability and skills regarding public policy issues. The course does not focus on methodology per se, but rather looks at the results of methodology as they frame and shape public policy issues. Thus the focus of the course is on the role of managers and executives in systematically seeking and organizing information to address policy problems. This course uses a combination of methods including seminar discussions, teamwork, field research, and take-home exams. Students are expected to participate actively in the learning process by: contributing their ideas and analysis during class; working collaboratively in teams; and supporting equitable team rules of engagement and contracts in project work."

  - :name: SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT
    :number: "729"
    :description: Sustainable development meets the needs of the present without compromising the wellbeing of future generations. Natural hazards, combined with social, economic and environmental vulnerability have resulted in disasters of devastating consequences that have macro impacts affecting development. During the last decades the amount and severity of natural hazards have increased together with the vulnerability of the population. The problem was supposed to affect just developing countries, but Katrina has shown how countries as the U.S. are also challenged. From a theoretical perspective, prevention of disasters is an optimal measure because it increases welfare. However, even if post disaster lending is the most expensive financial measure, currently disaster risk management relies on ex-post strategies based on expectation of external assistance. This module will focus on how risk management, inspired by the anticipated reduction of losses, is an investment in sustainable development that can reduce costs and generate income. Specific issued to be studied include conceptual and practical aspects related to risk evaluation, disaster risk management measures and financial mechanisms and strategies to transfer risk, as fundamental ways to complement mitigation and prevention.

    :number: "544"
    :description: Effective government is critical to helping secure the public welfare, achieve a just social order, create an environment in which private enterprise can thrive, and plan for a society's future. While many would agree with these propositions, the role and capacity of government in fact is highly contested. Historically the role of government has varied over time in all countries. However, over the last 25 years, the responsibilities of governments, their size, the scope of their responsibilities, and their capacity have been particularly challenged by proponents of privatization, downsizing, deregulation and other approaches to limit government. Many of these perspectives are echoed in other democracies around the globe, and are reinforced in developing countries by international financial institutions which have tended to recommend smaller government, reduced government subsidies, and privatizing public assets. The broad theme of the course is that the scope and capacity of government is critical not only to affecting outcomes in particular policy areas such as education, health care and the environment, but as very broad policy decisions themselves.

The basic objective is for students to integrate concepts, knowledge, and skills gained from the MPP program and apply these to current problems faced by real clients. Students earn academic credit while gaining professional experience and exposure to policy organizations in the public, private, and nonprofit sectors. Among other things, students will have the opportunity to work in groups, manage project tasks, meet deadlines, make decisions, develop strategies and plans, conduct and interpret analyses, deal with client managers and analysts, prepare research memos and briefing presentations, and build consulting skills. The faculty advisor will arrange client engagements and serve as an overall guide. But students will manage the projects as their own. PPOL 695 and 696 are intended for second-year MPP students only.

We will investigate the varied ways in which classic Russian authors and their readers (including our contemporaries, who grow up in Russia reading these works) pose the many convoluted questions related to the pursuit of love and happiness. How does one define happiness? What is a (or the) good life? How is romantic passion related to happiness and personal freedom? Finally, how do these authors perceive the role of society, gender, national identity, and religion within this complex equation, and how do those issues interact with the genre of the novel and the adultery plot?

This course introduces students to a number of primarily twentieth-century critical approaches to literature: Formalism, Structuralism, Post-Structuralism, Postmodernism, Psychoanalytic criticism, Marxism, Feminist criticism, Post-colonial criticism, and Hermeneutics. The course will provide an overview of each critical approach, but it does not pretend to be exhaustive. Instead it will be more in the nature of a survey of critical theory but in relation to a shared set of concerns. It will proceed largely in chronological order so that students see criticism as an inter-related and on-going dialogue. Discussion of each approach will focus on theoretical premises and implications and will investigate argumentation and grounds for critique. The aim is to illustrate the parameters (the range and domain) of each approach and how presuppositions shape conclusions. In addition students will analyze selected literary texts from the point of view of each of the approaches. The application of theory to literature will illustrate how theory can enrich our understanding of a literary text and reveal its multidimensional nature.

    :description: This course will address problems of culture-specific aspects in translation -- translation of idioms, associative layers in literary texts, allusions of all sorts, both linguo-cultural and political, differences in syntactic structures and types of semantic emphasis, and ways to avoid calques. Students will work on a whole array of texts that, for one reason or another, are considered to be "untranslatable." At the very least, we will try to define what is untranslatable -- i.e., culture- or structure-specific -- about them. This will allow students to learn ways to compensate for the untranslatable and to switch from one cultural code to the other, from the original language to the target one. The course will require in-class translation as well as a final project presented to the whole class, different for every student and based on his/her respective personal interest or area of concentration. Both in-class translations and these projects are to be graded. The final project is worth 50% of the grade. Most of the discussion will be in Russian, but the projects are, naturally, bilingual.

What artistic prisms does it choose to represent its own truth? Can it appear in disguise of its rival?

All the explanations provided by all the "-isms" and everyone's passionately personal "-ism" are true but insufficient. What is sufficient is unpronouceable. This course teaches us how Dostoevesky encodes unshakeable values in conspicuous omissions. He develops a powerful narrative and structural technique which treats precisely what matters most as unmentionable. This allows him to be tolerant toward a multitutde of voices without losing his own, as well as to move the forbidden from the realm of external law to that of the inner voice of one's conscience.

    :description: "This course focuses on Russian literature of the second half of the nineteenth century through the lens of the literary hero. The representation of the hero seems, at least in the eyes of Russia\xE2\x80\x99s critics, to present a \xE2\x80\x9Cproblem\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 in numerous instances, critics assert that the creation of \xE2\x80\x9Cweak\xE2\x80\x9D or \xE2\x80\x9Csuperfluous\xE2\x80\x9D literary heroes inevitably entails dire social consequences; real-life Russians are weak and ineffective because they have no strong models to inspire them. Russian authors, for their part, may agree or disagree with this notion. We will explore both the vision of the hero in its function within the larger work and the gap that develops between authors and critics of the time."

    :description: "The objective of the course is to introduce students to health and demographic issues and trends in the countries of the Eurasian, Russian, and East European region. Emphasis in the course will be upon recent, in some cases unprecedented, trends. The course starts with a brief introduction to basic health and demographic concepts. This is followed by a review of the demographic history of the USSR and Eastern Europe, which have been marked by various health and demographic calamities. Students are then given an introduction to sources of health and demographic data and information on the countries in the region. Following this are sections on each of the components of population change in the former USSR and Eastern Europe \xE2\x80\x93 fertility, morbidity, mortality, and migration -- along with domestic and international policies that have attempted to address those changes. Special emphasis will be placed on HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease, and other current leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the region, along with the policy and prevention programs associated with these conditions. There are also sections on the demographics of nationalities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe, population policy, and the linkages between the health and demographics of the region and education, the environment, pension systems, the labor force and other social and economic sectors. The final section examines health and population projections, where future trends are considered along with their implications. Emphasis will be placed on understanding of the causes and implications of health and demographic trends. The format of the course is a combination of lecture, case studies of actual health and demographic issues taken from the region (including in-class workshops), and discussion. A research paper is required on a health or demographic issue from the region, and there will be two take-home examinations. Knowledge of Russian is desirable but not mandatory. No prior knowledge of demography is required."

Allowing for national differences, we will analyze the common features that affected cultural products such as cinema: the abrupt transition from a centralized economy to a free-market economy which resulted in the disintegration of the film industry infrastructure and the search for new means of production. We will also look at the films of \xE2\x80\x9Cshock capitalism\xE2\x80\x9D and discuss how the themes and concerns being treated tell the story of that particular period\xE2\x80\x94the sudden achievement of freedom, liberalization, and privatization, and the many difficulties societies had in adapting to the new reality. Cinema will be discussed as an index of socio-political trends as well as a medium in its own right. Therefore, we will consider film as text, and analyze the feelings it stirs, the models it evokes, and the message it conveys. To this end, we will cover the basic elements and techniques of film language (shots, editing, mise-en-sc\xC3\xA8ne, etc.), and the process of visual perception that affects the audience. Theoretical frameworks such as Structuralism and discourse theory will be employed to analyze the films.

How does one define happiness? What is a (or the) good life? How is romantic passion related to happiness and personal freedom? Finally, how do these authors perceive the role of society, gender, national identity, and religion within this complex equation, and how do those issues interact with the genre of the novel and the adultery plot?

    :number: "467"
    :description: The past half century has brought tremendous change to the Middle East. There has been a fundamental remaking of the cultural and political landscape as modern states have emerged from Imperial and Colonial rule. This remaking has been accompanied by an enormous but unevenly distributed increase wealth, civil wars, wars with the State of Israel and the sharp rise of political Islam as a challenge to autocratic but secular states. In this process, two factors have been largely ignored. The first is the rapid urbanization of societies that until the recent past were primarily rural and agrarian in nature. The second, and one in part due to the process of urbanization, is the transformation of gender roles in Middle East society, in particular the slow but steady emergence of women in the political and economic affairs of the region. This course will examine these two transformations in an effort not only to better understand the modern Middle East but in an effort to gain insight into the possible directions Middle Eastern nations may follow in the future. Readings will include not only economic and political documents but also works that chronicle and chart changing gender and social roles and the influence they exert on the varied societies of the region. Course requirements will include and active participation in the discussion of the texts as well as two ten page papers.

Russian cinema will be discussed as an index of sociopolitical trends over the years, as well as a medium in its own right. Therefore, attention will be devoted to historical turning points that affected the cultural policies of the Soviet Union, and consequently the styles, themes, and quality of filmmaking. At the same time, the course will consider the film as text, and analyze the feelings it stirs, the moods it evokes, and the ideological message it conveys. To this end, the course will cover the basic elements and techniques of film language (shots, montage, mise en scene, etc.) and the process of visual perception that affects the audience. Spring."

    :number: "400"
    :description: "This is a Government Department Seminar for advanced undergraduate students. It is also open to Graduate Students in SFS MA programs. Because it is a new course, the full syllabus will be available in August. Department Seminars focus on writing and research. Assignments for the course will consist of several short analytical essays and one longer paper focusing on an individual comparative research project. THE PROBLEM: Communism as an economic and social system was abandoned almost everywhere within a remarkably short period of time, a period that coincided with the late 20th century era of globalization. We will begin by exploring the relationship between globalization and the demise of Communism. The bulk of the semester will be devoted to examining the main social-economic systems that have replaced communism in the context of globalization. About a dozen countries are geographically situated to join the European Union. While this process will be neither smooth nor painless, it is pretty straightforward. For other countries, there are two major development models. China offers the model of economic integration with the global economy without ending Communist Party rule. Soviet leaders introduced major political changes in an attempt to advance economic reforms, leading to the breakup of the USSR. Many Russian leaders express ambivalence about Western models of development, arguing that there is a \"third way\" between American-dominated global capitalism and their communist past. Both China and Russia have been among the world's fastest-growing economies in the first years of the 21st century. They present two competing models for development, differing markedly in their structural and existential relationships with the global economy. While Russia and China will be our primary focus, we will respect Mark Bloch's admonition that any comparison must involve more than two cases by making frequent reference to the experience of ex-communist EU accession countries and India. MAJOR THEMES: After examining the exit from communism in the context of globalization and the basic development models in Russia and China, we will compare the two countries across a range of issues including WTO accession, labor, business and the middle class, civil society, crime and corruption, income differentials and welfare, religion and culture, and human capital.

We begin with the \"first transition\" to the capitalist Market economy in Western Europe and related social changes, starting with the discipline required by \"industrial time\" and eventually including more open political systems. We then turn to the \"World Revolution of Westernization\" in the 19th and 20th centuries, which laid the foundation for globalization. The major focus is on the \"Third Wave\" of democratization that commenced in the 1970s, the character of transitions in Communist nations, and the relationship of these transitions to processes frequently described as \"globalization.\" We will examine similarities and differences in transitions in different parts of the world, and will attempt to discern the homogenizing and differentiating impact of increasingly interconnected economies, trans-national actors, and new information technologies.

This course introduces students to a number of primarily twentieth-century critical approaches to literature: Formalism, Structuralism, Post-Structuralism, Postmodernism, Psychoanalytic criticism, Marxism, Feminist criticism, Post-colonial criticism, and Hermeneutics. The course will provide an overview of each critical approach, but it does not pretend to be exhaustive. Instead it will be more in the nature of a survey of critical theory but in relation to a shared set of concerns. It will proceed largely in chronological order so that students see criticism as an inter-related and on-going dialogue. Discussion of each approach will focus on theoretical premises and implications and will investigate argumentation and grounds for critique. The aim is to illustrate the parameters (the range and domain) of each approach and how presuppositions shape conclusions. In addition students will analyze selected literary texts from the point of view of each of the approaches. The application of theory to literature will illustrate how theory can enrich our understanding of a literary text and reveal its multidimensional nature. All critical and literary texts (stories, poems, excerpts) are in English."

    :description: This Colloquium is the capstone course for students completing the Undergraduate Certificate in Russian and East European Studies. The goal is to permit each student to synthesize the knowledge gained from studying the region. This will be done in two ways. We will read five books that raise key questions relating to the experience of communism and its demise. These books will be discussed at class meetings, and students will write three short essays (each approximately 1000 words) using these readings as a basis for discussing issues he/she finds of interest. In addition, each student will carry out an independent research project focused on a topic that draws on the specific course work he/she has undertaken in the past four years. Class meetings will provide opportunities for students to report on the progress of their research. Alternate weeks are reserved for individual consultations with the instructor, and students are expected to use this time for discussion of both the required readings and their individual research projects. Written Assignments for the semester will include two short essays (approximately 1000 words) and a research paper (thesis). The research paper will be on a topic selected by the student in close consultation with the instructor. In addition to the written assignments, each student will make an oral presentation of the main findings of their research during one of the last two class meetings.

    :description: "This seminar is devoted to an examination of post-Soviet Russian legal reform. Among the questions we will examine from different perspectives: What were the starting points for reform of the Soviet legal system? What reforms have been accomplished in the past 15 years? How do we measure the distances between these points? The first half of the seminar will emphasize theoretical, political, and historical predicates to these questions. The second half of the seminar is devoted to a more substantive examination of selected legal topics. This seminar will take an insistently inter-disciplinary and comparative approach. The legal systems of nineteenth century Russia, the post-socialist states of Central and Eastern Europe, the United States, and Western Europe will all be points of comparison. No previous study of law or legal training (in any legal system) is required, or even expected. Our discussions will center around texts drawn from political science, history, law, and literature. All readings may be found in Georgetown University libraries and all readings will be in English."

    :number: "359"
    :description: The course explores critically important theories of ethnicity and nationalism, with focus on their relevance for cases within the post-Soviet states, East-Central Europe and the Balkans. Comparative discussions enable analysis of data from South and Central Asia, the Middle East and North America. Cases are selected in part for their fame in the political anthropology literature. While various approaches are presented, stress is on viewing ethnicity and nationalism as socio-politically constructed, situational and in flux. Debates concerning liberal nationalism, empires, colonialism, multiethnic state formation, nation state models, borders, federalism, civic society, multiculturalism, interethnic conflict and racism are covered.

    :description: "This course will examine ways of \xE2\x80\x9Cseeing\xE2\x80\x9D objects of visual expression in the fields of art, communications, and entertainment, in relation to their cultural and political contexts. Scientific research demonstrates that we see individually and collectively, responding to the visual stimuli that excite our nervous system (the physiological function) as well as to factors relative to our social surroundings and historical time (the cultural function). In this course, we will cover the basic \xE2\x80\x9Cgrammar\xE2\x80\x9D of visual literacy to gain an awareness of why we see what we see. This involves a close scrutiny of the component elements of visual images, and the way these elements relate to each other to generate meaning. We will also discuss the cultural factors that affect meaning, paying particular attention to the manufacturing of objects of visual expression for political, ideological, and commercial purposes."

  - :name: Applied Country Analysis
    :number: "566"
    :description: This course will provide a practical quantitative exercise in identifying, estimating, and designing policy responses to problems of macroeconomic instability in developing, emerging, and transition economies. Students will calculate indicators used in assessing macroeconomic balance (such as rates of growth and inflation, the relative fiscal deficit, and change in the real exchange rate), and use statistical tools to analyze alternative policy outcomes. The quantitative tools will be introduced in the course. Students will write a paper describing their results for classroom presentation and discussion. Undergraduate course members may write their papers in two-person teams. In their papers, authors apply quantitative assessment and policy design tools to a country and macroeconomic episode of their choosing--for example, spiraling inflation in Argentina at the end of the 1980s, balance of payments developments in Mexico in the run-up to the 1994 election, the growth rate in the Philippines in the late-Marcos and early-Aquino years, or monetary expansion in the Ukraine after early transition. The course focuses on short-run macroeconomic stabilization issues (rather than on growth, income distribution, or development in general) and on basic quantitative tools. Those with backgrounds in econometrics can make use of sophisticated statistical techniques in the estimation part of the course, but estimates based on simpler methods are fully acceptable. This course will be useful to upperclass-undergraduates and M.A. students in MSB, SFS, and area studies M.A. programs who have an interest and/or potential career involvement in country macroeconomic assessment, the environment for investment, currency and balance of payments analysis, achievement of short-run macroeconomic performance objectives, globalization issues, and/or practices and policies of international financial institutions. In addition to the two regular lecture sessions per week, there will be an optional evening lab session for additional help and/or office hours. Spring. Same as ECON 331

Each course will be announced in the course schedule and receive its own sub-title. In Spring 2006 the following course is offered: Russia through western eyes (Professor Anton Fedyashin). Between the 1860s and the 1930s, a conflict raged between Russia\xE2\x80\x99s historical identity and modernity\xE2\x80\x99s rapid and destabilizing changes. The Bolshevik Revolution was an important stage in this development. What better time to explore the national character than when it proves its mettle under stress? This course will explore how some of the brightest Western minds interpreted Russian history and defined its complex society between 1860 and 1941. Two central issues will set the tone for the seminar. We will consider how and to what extent contemporary events and geography influenced Western opinions of Russia. Simultaneously, we will examine the validity of the East/West divide and its implications. The issues we will address in this course have not lost their contemporary importance. Russia\xE2\x80\x99s identity search reemerged with its full cultural and geopolitical significance in the post-Soviet era. Today, perhaps more so than ever, the nation struggles with issues similar to those covered in this course. The West continues to judge this development. Spring."

Financial liberalization in these countries has often involved contrasting polices. On the one hand, governments in capital-scarce economies have retreated from direct involvement in the allocation of financial resources. On the other hand, government authorities have also intervened in financial markets to protect consumers and investors\xE2\x80\x94by promoting fairness and transparency in financial transactions and financial stability. Financial crises in emerging (and even in more developed!) markets throughout the 1990s, however, raise several questions regarding the effectiveness of the financial reforms undertaken in those countries.

    :description: This course will address problems of culture-specific aspects in translation -- translation of idioms, associative layers in literary texts, allusions of all sorts, both linguo-cultural and political, differences in syntactic structures and types of semantic emphasis, and ways to avoid calques. Students will work on a whole array of texts that, for one reason or another, are considered to be "untranslatable." At the very least, we will try to define what is untranslatable -- i.e., culture- or structure-specific -- about them. This will allow students to learn ways to compensate for the untranslatable and to switch from one cultural code to the other, from the original language to the target one. The course will require in-class translation as well as a final project presented to the whole class, different for every student and based on his/her respective personal interest or area of concentration. Both in-class translations and these projects are to be graded. The final project is worth 50% of the grade. Most of the discussion will be in Russian, but the projects are, naturally, bilingual.

    :description: This course (taught in English) explores the Four Great Murder Novels, and, time permitting, -The Adolescent-. How can all the "-isms" Dostoevsky's characters and narrators so passionately proclaim agree with what the writer himself regarded as a system of absolute values? All the explanations provided by all the "-isms" and everyone's passionately personal "-ism" are true but insufficient. What is sufficient is unpronouceable. This course teaches us how Dostoevesky encodes unshakeable values in conspicuous omissions. He develops a powerful narrative and structural technique which treats precisely what matters most as unmentionable. This allows him to be tolerant toward a multitutde of voices without losing his own, as well as to move the forbidden from the realm of external law to that of the inner voice of one's conscience. There is a mid-term examination and a final paper. (Conducted in English; no knowledge of the Russian language required.)

This course will examine how environmental change, both gradual and abrupt, has impacted cultures from around the world at various times in prehistory. The focus is on what archaeology, geology, and paleoecology can teach us about how people adapt to changes in their environment. Through the analysis of selected case studies, the course will examine the impact of climate change, sea-level rise, and land use on human settlements, subsistence, and social organization. The course will explore both the physical evidence for environmental change, and the archaeological evidence for cultural response. Examples will be drawn from various ancient cultures, including those of Mexico, Greece, and California. A summary session at the end of the course will relate what we have learned about past events to possible future environmental problems and solutions.

    :number: "311"
    :description: "This is a basic upper division course in geomorphology, a core subject of geography and geology and integral to many other sciences. Geomorphology is a science that studies the landforms of planetary surfaces and the processes that create these landforms. The field has a long history that stretches back to the earliest speculation about the earth; humans are innately interested in the landscape about them. Since many universities have many related courses where we have but one, I focus on three central themes: (1) a survey of geomorphic forms and processes, (2) some basic analytical skills including some field experience, and (3) some practical applications, especially to ecology and geological hazards. The analytical skills we develop in this course include: map and areal photography interpretation, landscape analysis, some field methods, natural hazards assessment, and the applications of some basic mathematical models. We will concentrate on the external agents of geomorphic change (water, ice, wind, and chemical change), but we must also study the tectonics and structure of the earth in order to understand its surface."

    :description: "This class will explore the politics of international health. The world is becoming increasingly inter-related; trade relationships are becoming stronger and more intertwined, and travel between nations is fast and easy. The international movement of people and goods across national borders makes the emergence or re-emergence of infectious disease in one country of great importance to its region and the world community. Yet, traditional conceptions of state sovereignty can limit the ability of international organizations and foreign states to intervene. Health threats can destabilize countries internally (for example, Stephen Lewis, the UN Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa, has stated that he \xE2\x80\x9Cwouldn\xE2\x80\x99t discount the possibility, ten to fifteen years down the road, of failed states\xE2\x80\x9D as a result of HIV/AIDS) and can strain international relations. States often have powerful political and economic incentives to hide emerging diseases or downplay their importance. On the other hand, providing international assistance for public health disasters can strengthen international institutions and diplomatic relationships, increase stability, and save lives. This class examines international and national structures, relationships, and mechanisms that influence global health."

    :description: "This course will begin by giving an overall world perspective on energy issues. It will then give an overview of the political and economic situations first in the North Africa and Levant region, and then in the Gulf. Then it will turn to the technology, business, politics, culture, diplomacy, history, warfare, and economics related to oil, natural gas, electricity, nuclear power, and alternative energies in the area. The class then turns to case studies focusing on: Iran (especially the oil-gas-nuclear connections); Iraq and Lebanon (the ravages of war and rebuilding after war); and Egypt, Algeria and Morocco (energy and development issues). The class will then consider the energy-environment-water-food nexus in the region with a focus on urban-rural divides. There will be some consideration of the possible effects of climate change in the region, especially in Egypt. Then we will turn to the \"energy scramble\" and the importance of the region to China, the EU, India and the US. The Sudan, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Iraq, Iran, Algeria and Libya will be stressed in this class. The class will then delve into the very complex area of how comprehensive peace could be built by energy connections, and what comprehensive peace could do for energy developments and energy-development connections in the region. We will end with a series of in-class debates on some special topics developed out of the class over the term."

  - :name: The Future of World Energy
    :number: "458"
    :description: Energy is a key driver of human progress, economic prosperity, business opportunity and social well being, and the dominant factor affecting global climate change. Revolutionary changes are sweeping through the energy sector, with profound implications for business, technological innovation and global security. Governments are yielding power to business and market forces, and are introducing competition into electricity and gas markets previously regarded as natural monopolies. Mergers and acquisitions abound in the energy sector, and several successful business models continue after the collapse of Enron. Capital mobilization in the energy sector will come predominantly from the private sector over the next two decades and will become a daunting task, particularly in Russia and the developing world. Technological innovation in the energy sector is more vigorous and dynamic than at any time since the dawn of the industrial era, and is deeply affected by information technology advances. Energy businesses have increasingly embraced environmental sustainability as an opportunity, not a constraint. Visionary corporate leaders are fostering technological and organizational innovations that protect the environment and boost the "bottom line." The course will review these major contemporary energy developments, including the transformation of business strategies in the energy industry, the changing relationship of governments and market forces, new concepts of energy security, unprecedented technological innovation and concern for the local and global environment. The course is designed to provide students with a sophisticated and multifaceted insight into the future of energy business and technology, government-business relationships in the energy sector, and an understanding of major international energy developments. The course will provide an analytic basis for examining and formulating energy policy. It may be taken by undergraduate and graduate students from anywhere in the university. It will be suitable for policy generalists, as well as for students with a business or science background.

    :description: "This course, offered jointly by specialists in organization and management, legal and regulatory systems, and economics and finance, will be available to graduate and under-graduate students. The exceptionality of HIV and AIDS led to the decision of the international community to establish the Joint United Nations Program on AIDS in the mid-1990s and the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in 2002. Despite notable success in organizing for the fight against AIDS, there are still more than forty million persons living with the disease. Its impact has been particularly grave in sub-Saharan Africa and other low-income countries. Ignorance, denial, stigma, discrimination and legal frameworks continue to militate against efforts to promote positive behavioral change. This course will explore HIV/AIDS from several perspectives: epidemiological, financial, national (governance, organization, social context) and international (cooperation and regulation). It will address issues such as: How must affected countries organize their efforts to be successful? What is the proper role for international donors and organizations? What legal and regulatory issues must be resolved at national and international levels? How can we achieve equity and universal access to prevention and treatment?"

The student will acquire the basics of descriptive and analytical epidemiology and key health indicators used in international comparisons. This course discusses questions raised by the World Health Organization's World Health Report 1998: Will the world continue to grow healthier in the 21st century, with more diseases conquered by scientific advances and life expectancy extending ever longer, or will new diseases, failing drugs, poverty, and socioeconomic gaps cancel out these gains? How does the health situation of the U.S. compare with other countries? How can the health situation of the population in developed and underdeveloped countries be improved? Looking at major determinants of health and disease in different national contexts, the student will analyze the main transnational factors that influence the transfer of risks to health and the structural conditions that determines one country's vulnerability in a globalized economy."

  - :name: Introduction to Environmental Science
    :number: "102"
    :description: "This is an introductory course on the science of environmental systems. We will survey the breadth of this interdisciplinary field with lectures, discussions, and laboratory and field exercises designed to introduce the basics of what I think every citizen should know. Whatever one's ideological perspective, environmental science is about the home of humanity, our basic life-support systems. We introduce the earth's spheres: atmosphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and biosphere. These make life, including human life, possible, and understanding them is analogous to a scuba diver understanding scuba tanks. Humans influence each of these spheres, sometimes in ways that affect the production of ecosystem services for humans and the whole ecosystem. Thus, we study the scientific aspects of how these systems work and how humans are changing and, in some cases, degrading them. For example, we study the systems of the atmosphere that support and influence life, and we study air pollution and how the atmosphere may both accentuate and ameliorate pollution. Environmental science has always been a science that integrates natural with social science because it studies natural systems not only to understand nature but also to understand human relationships with nature. Global Warming, for example, is a central concern of environmental science, but to understand it fully requires we must understand the history and science of natural climate change, the history of human-induced greenhouse gas emissions, and the models that predict climate change. Moreover, environmental science has always been an applied science; thus we must also introduce the practical approaches for solving problems. The course will emphasize the positive gains as well as the abject failures of human-environment interactions. We will compare different management approaches (such as market-based, grass-roots, and command-and-control) and the government (such as the EPA) and non government entities (such as the World Bank) that influence them."

The course will cover topics relevant to coastal zones (estuaries, mangroves, reef ecosystems, bays), to continental shelves and slopes (gravity slides), and deep-sea abyssal plains and vents. Topics such as sea level rise, coastal development, coral reef diversity, fisheries, polar seas, mineral and fossil fuel resources, law of the sea, endangered species, and the carbon cycle and ocean uptake of carbon will be covered. Although a global view is necessary to understand certain critical ocean-related issues, many policy issues are pertinent at local and regional spatial scales, such as the "dead zone" in the Gulf of Mexico, iron fertilization of tropical oceans systems, sea level inundation of low-lying nations, estuarine pollution and hypoxia, and the impact of land use on coastal regions, and water and coastal zone management.

    :number: "393"
    :description: Weapons technology has historically threatened the security of political entities even as they have relied on it for their survival. The relationship between security and technology is inherently political. Security related technology is most often selected, invested in, developed, deployed, restrained and retired on the basis of domestic politics and/or international political considerations. Conversely, access to and exploitation of technology has an enormous impact on the internal politics and external political influence of a state by framing its identity, expectations, demand power, institutional role and structural position within international society. The triangular relationship of security, technology and politics forms the focal core of this course. We will explore this triad by studying the historic life-cycle process of weapons development; by experimenting, via simulation, with the trade-offs in technological choice and investment as well as the combined-arms security effects of asymmetrical systems; by analyzing how the major international actors anticipate and manage technological change in constructing their security environment; and by assessing the implications of evolving technology for US security strategy.

Students will learn to assess the impact of rapid, discontinuous technical innovation on foreign policy outcomes, analyze the conditions for successful or flawed technical innovation, and trace the underlying scientific source of these innovations. Cases include Space Imaging Inc. and high resolution satellite imaging; Merck, protease inhibitors, and the African HIV pandemic; DoubleClick, Internet database mining, and the European Privacy Directive; Myriad Genomics and the breast cancer gene patent dispute; and Monsanto, transgenic grains, and the WTO. These cases are used to illustrate a set of management tools such as development cycles, return on investment criteria, \xE2\x80\x9Cnested\xE2\x80\x9D innovation, and R&D portfolio evaluation. From a more theoretical perspective, this course focuses on the interface between regulatory policy and markets, between the theory of public goods and the hard realities of private profit. The lessons from these cases will be useful for students who become regulators or NGO administrators seeking to harness private sector innovation to public policy goals, as well as (conversely) for those who become business managers grappling with complex international regulatory challenges."

The current information age is characterized in terms of the conjunction of fast, cheap telecommunications with cheap and expanding computer power, so that the Internet makes it possible to share and manipulate data - and build transnational communities of interest - with no regard for distance. Trends in the growth and availability of information technology are aligned with trends in the nature of international relations. The course also explores the impact of information technology on both the stakes of international competition and conflict, and the means by which such conflicts are conducted. There is a special focus on such topics as the trade-offs between governmental effectiveness and individual autonomy and privacy; the extent to corporate access to data represents a new challenge to privacy; the changes in the ways that wealth and power interact with each other on the world stage; and how the nature of state sovereignty has evolved. The course also examines diplomatic policy issues raised by the growth of the global information infrastructure, the information services it provides, and the business it empowers. The course is non-technical, althoug the instructors provide a layman's view and (condensed) history of information technology.

These revolutions in information and technology are also increasing trade integration and other interdependences across countries and regions. The course starts with a brief overview of the role of technology in growth and development, as well as the basics of invention, innovation, and commercialization of technology. It explores the interplay between four critical elements of a country's readiness to take advantage of these revolutions: a demanding economic incentive and institutional regime; an educated and skilled population; a dynamic information infrastructure; and an effective innovation system. It uses measures of these elements to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the US, the main European countries, Japan, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, and major developing regions. It also explores how the technology and information revolutions affect four key issues of global concern: inequality, security, sustainability, and quality of life. With these building blocks and some basic assumptions about key political and economic trends, students will be asked to project how the world may look in 2020, and to propose actions to improve these prospective futures.

What is the relationship between foreign policy, law enforcement and warfare in our response to terrorism? What constraints, if any, should we apply to ourselves in responding to terrorism? The course continues by examining the debate about reforming our governmental bureaucracy responsible for responding to terrorism. Why did we not recognize the emerging threat of the 9/11 attacks? What principles should we apply in reforming our intelligence and homeland defense organizations? The course concludes with close examination of sociological perspectives on designing effective organizations for responding to threats including biothreats. What should we do to improve how our existing food safety bureaucracy protects us against natural biothreats? Why do organizational failures occur even in organizations well prepared for contingencies? Can we design organizations capable of responding to novel threats and unanticipated events? Students should gain an appreciation of the fundamentally political character of biodefense as a result of completing this course.

    :description: "The Internet--glorified, vilified, and/or taken for granted--is a great vehicle for exploring many public policy issues. Who's in charge? Who cares? Understanding how to think about these and more specific questions is key to understanding how we came to have the Internet we have today and what might happen to it in the future. This seminar will examine how the Internet touches on or is touched by many kinds of policy, beginning with technology policy and extending to telecommunications policy, information policy, and more. It will address such questions as: What makes the Internet's technology special--how (and why) does it differ from other approaches to networking, and what do those differences imply? How have its availability and uses been changing, and what do those changes imply? How are the roles of different interest parties (categories of users, government entities, commercial entities, NGOs) evolved, and with what effect? Where is regulation in the context of the Internet? How has the Internet developed as a global construct, and how have different governments and policies affected it? How do responses to the side-effects of Internet use (e.g., privacy and security impacts) affect it? What does growing acceptance of the Internet as infrastructure imply? How might technological advances affect the Internet of the future--and related policy? Students should expect a range of readings, in-class discussion, and paper-writing assignments."

It has been crafted with America\xE2\x80\x99s current involvement in Iraq in mind and therefore is intended to acquaint students with the nature, dimensions and history insurgency and counterinsurgency both past and present and by doing so to establish a solid foundation upon which further expertise can be built and analytical capabilities with respect to future eventualities developed. The course considers a wide range of questions in order to provide students with a deeper understanding of evolution of insurgent strategy and tactics over time and the development of government counterinsurgency doctrine. Among the questions it examines are: What is insurgency and how does it differ from guerrilla warfare and terrorism? How have insurgent strategies and tactics changed over time? Who are the foremost ideological and doctrinal exponents of insurgency and why? Who are the foremost counterinsurgency practitoner-theorists? Why does insurgency succeed and fail? How can insurgency best be fought? Why is the wheel seemingly always re-invented in counterinsurgency? Specifically, the course will analyze both insurgency\xE2\x80\x99s effectiveness as a means to achieve political change and the challenges faced by the liberal democratic state in responding to insurgent campaigns and challenges."

    :number: "538"
    :description: "This class is designed to help students understand the dynamics of modern conventional military operations in all their dimensions. It is intended for students considering careers in the armed forces, the intelligence community, military contracting, academic security studies, as well as those who simply have a keen interest in analyzing and understanding conventional military operations. The principal method of this course will be to examine key battles and campaigns of the Second World War and to identify critical decisions, capabilities, or other factors that produced the historical result\xE2\x80\x94and might have resulted in a very different outcome had they proven otherwise. The class will employ both counterfactuals and alternative analyses to explore the range of potential outcomes of different cases. The purpose of these exercises, and the goal of the class, will be to help the student consider current or future conventional military situations and assess how they should or could develop based on what would inevitably be only partial information, i.e., less information than what we now know about the World War II cases. For instance, predicting the ability of one country to invade its neighbor is inherently difficult; however, a thorough understanding of German success over France in 1940 and its ultimate failure against Russia in 1941 can help illustrate the critical variables in any such scenario, and therefore focus the intelligence analyst on key questions and information gaps, and the military planner on key objectives and capabilities. For all of these reasons, students will be expected to carry a considerable workload both in terms of readings and class participation. Students will be expected to participate in detailed debates on topics ranging from the strategic to the tactical level, and so will be expected to have internalized the historical materials necessary to do so. Although this course employs the campaigns and battles of World War II as its course material, it is NOT a class on World War II history. Consequently, no more than a rudimentary understanding of World War II history is necessary as a prerequisite. By the same token, this is also NOT a course on the basics of military forces\xE2\x80\x94students should have an understanding of military forces and operations (what a division or an air wing consists of, what does \xE2\x80\x9Ccombined arms\xE2\x80\x9D refer to, what strategic vs. tactical air power refers to) although no more than the basics are required."

It will call on your creativity as well as your self-discipline; we'll be able to add any and all of our ideas to the simulation, both in its design and in its content, but we'll also be running said game during the ninth week of our course-which will demand a good deal of focused work in the early weeks to make sure we're on track. The course is built around some of the best literature on decision-making as a discipline. Some of the literature will come from the international relations tradition, but much of it is general, and the disciplines we'll learn can apply to any decisions at all-not only ones about international security issues, but business, social, or personal decisions as well. Learning objectives include a good sense of how to make a good decision, the limits of effective decision-making strategies, and the design and execution of strategic-level wargames.

It traces the spread of nuclear weapons during the Cold War era to the five declared nuclear powers and acquisition of nuclear capabilities by other states. Early international efforts to manage nuclear technology are assessed. Challenges in the post-Cold War period are identified, notably the increased global spread of chemical and biological weapons capabilities as well as ballistic missiles. The effects of these trends on regional stability, international diplomacy, arms control, and US national security are explored. US responses are investigated in terms of policy priorities, relative effectiveness of alternative courses of action, and balance between national and international instruments. Specific attention is paid to the relationship between non-proliferation and counterproliferation (i.e., arms control and military-based policies).

  - :name: Economics of Sub-State Violence
    :number: "590"
    :description: "Violence represents an option. Someone chooses violence when optimal. They choose it when the next best non-violent alternative is inferior, or not preferred. When those who chose violence run governments, and they choose violence against another country, we call this war. But violence is not limited to between-state armed conflicts. And people in charge of much less than a state choose violence: criminals, rebels, and terrorists. As policymakers and analysts, we often study the actions of states and heads of states. What can we learn from the study of sub state violence? It is certainly relevant, especially in the post-9/11 world. What do we know about civil wars, criminal activity, and terrorism? What can each teach us about the other? What can we learn from a rigorous analytical approach to these questions? This course will provide its participants with an opportunity for such a rigorous analysis. We will apply economic analysis to the questions of various types of sub-state violence. We will look for insights and analysis that can be applied to real-world problems. I expect this course to innovate. It is a \xE2\x80\x9Csurvey\xE2\x80\x9D course in its breadth but will be run in a \xE2\x80\x9Cseminar\xE2\x80\x9D style. We will spend a lot of time reviewing academic literature in order to identify worthwhile economic analysis. We will then look to case studies to identify effective and efficient policies. Although we will spend a lot of time on economic theory, no economic background is required for this course. Students will take an active part in the learning process. Each student must be prepared each week to lead class discussions on assigned readings. I encourage working in groups."

    :number: "593"
    :description: "Until recently, national security was regarded as the province of foreign ministries, defense ministries and intelligence services. One of the developments in recent years in international security policy throughout the world is the increasing role played by finance ministries. Since September 11, there has been a rapid expansion in the international community\xE2\x80\x99s willingness and ability to use the international financial system as a pressure point to address a wide range of international security concerns from terrorism to WMD proliferation to rogue regimes. In fact, in the past few years, virtually every UN Security Council Resolution passed has included financial measures (e.g. UNSCRs related to terrorism, Iran, North Korea, the Hariri Assassination and Liberia, to name a few). The U.S. has become increasingly sophisticated in its ability to use financial tools, both unilaterally and multilaterally, to disrupt the support networks of terrorists, organized criminals, and WMD proliferators, and to apply pressure on regimes such as Iran and North Korea. The important role the U.S. Treasury Department has played in the Iran and North Korea WMD issues would have been inconceivable just a few years ago. This course will first examine the history of U.S. and international efforts to work through the international financial system to address law enforcement and national security issues. It will then examine how those efforts were transformed after September 11 to deprive bad actors of access to the international financial system and to use that system to achieve specific international security outcomes. The course will examine relevant primary international instruments such as the UN Narcotics Convention, the UN Convention for the Suppression of Financing of Terrorism, the UN Convention on Transnational Organized Crime and an array of UNSCRs. Particular focus also will be paid to the work of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the premier international body which sets and seeks to ensure global compliance with AML/CFT standards. Issues related to FATF also will tie in to other international institutions like the IMF, the World Bank and FATF-Style Regional Bodies (FSRBs). Finally, the course will examine U.S. financial tools such as those available in the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA), the Bank Secrecy Act and the USA PATRIOT Act, and how those tools have been applied in instances such as Iran, North Korea, and more generally to the War on Terrorism. This course will discuss important policy debates, both domestically and internationally, regarding the important role of the international financial system as well as policy discussions regarding the appropriate use of financial measures and other tools. This course is a seminar, structured to teach students practical skills necessary to contribute as active players in the dynamic policy environment of the U.S. government. Class meetings will be driven by student participation and will simulate interagency coordination processes in reaching national policy decisions and/or in assessing threats to U.S. interests. Guests will include U.S. government officials who will speak on the nature and origins of U.S. policy regarding national security and the international financial system."

    :description: "Terrorism has gone from a persistent yet marginal security concern to one of the most important problems of our day. As the September 11, 2001 attacks made clear, terrorists can and will kill thousands to pursue their ends. In addition to threatening the United States, terrorists menace governments worldwide: indeed, there are few if any countries that do not suffer from some form of terrorism. This course examines a wide range of questions in order to provide students with a deeper understanding of the threat of terrorism today. Among the questions it examines are: What is terrorism? How has the threat of terrorism changed over time? What motivates different types of terrorist groups? When does terrorism succeed and fail? How can terrorism best be fought? This course explores the nature of terrorism, the motivations of terrorists, and the tactics that terrorists use. It surveys state-sponsored terrorist groups, as well as several leading past and current radical groups. The final weeks of the course will assess different methods of countering terrorism, ranging from law enforcement to covert action."

    :description: "The study of civil-military relations addresses a simple puzzle: can we have a military strong enough to protect civilians yet not so strong as to ignore or subvert civilian direction? After all, a military that is strong enough to defend the state from its external enemies is also strong enough to seize power so as to rule for itself. How do you have a strong military capability without being swallowed by it? In this course, we will examine the variety of ways that the civil-military relationship can vary -- how political leaders, society and military organizations interact, and how their cultures overlap and diverge. We will explore how this relationship can matter for important political outcomes, such as regime change, democratization, military policy, decision-making in crises and wars, military innovation and defense transformation, and military effectiveness. Students will master the basic theories of civil-military relations, study past and current controversies, and develop awareness of issues that remain unsettled, such as the use of military forces to handle domestic crises like Hurricane Katrina. The course will focus primarily on the US case, but the theoretical frameworks covered have broad application to other advanced democracies and developing countries. Students will be required to attend a battlefield staff ride of Antietam on one Saturday during the semester."

    :description: "This course provides an introduction to diagnostic net assessment as conceived in the early 1970s within the National Security Council and subsequently practiced by the Department of Defense since 1973. Diagnostic net assessment aims at providing top decision makers with objective assessments of where the United States currently stands relative to prospective opponents in key areas of long-term military competition, and examines major trends and asymmetries to identify emerging problems and opportunities that could affect the U.S. position in the future. Net assessments take into account the strategic goals, doctrines, operational concepts, and fundamental military capabilities (especially strengths and weaknesses) of competing countries, alliances, and other international actors. Net assessments are usually subject to uncertainty and a given \xE2\x80\x9Cbalance\xE2\x80\x9D usually need to take into account factors such as demographics, economic strength and budgetary constraints, organizational behavior, competitor assessments, strategic culture, and disruptive technologies.

Finally, the course will consider incipient trends which are likely to intensify in the coming years, such as China's changing role in the region. Although security issues in the majority of Southeast Asian countries will be covered through the main course themes, two individual country case studies, on Burma and Indonesia, will offer more intense focus.

    :description: This course examines a range of South Asian security issues. With the explosion in May 1998 of at least ten nuclear weapons by India and Pakistan, world interest is again focused on South Asia. This course looks beyond these tests and explores a number of broader and prior questions. These include the way in which the political and social infrastructures of India and Pakistan affect regional security calculations, the waxing and waning of American influence on these two states, and the possible "emergence" of India as a middle power. The nuclear tests themselves will be examined, and the emergence of an India-China-Pakistan nuclear triad explored. This course will also survey the existing literature on South Asian foreign policy and suggest where new or innovative research may be possible.

    :description: This course examines the historical evolution of the international arms trade, focusing on the economics of international arms transfers since the end of the Cold War and on the trials and tribulations of international efforts to control arms trafficking. The international trade in conventional weapons has changed in important ways since the end of the Cold War. The existence of large inventories of weapons and the perpetuation of large production capacities in the West, the former Soviet bloc, and many other countries has generated a barrage of activity that is largely beyond international control. Arms are plentiful and cheap, and this has had devastating consequences in many parts of the world. This course analyzes these important issues in detail.

    :description: Since September 11, the United States has viewed terrorist acquisition and use of chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) weapons as one of the gravest threats to national security. The course provides an in-depth understanding of the history of WMD terrorism, the current challenges posed by this threat, and the range of national and international policy tools available to address this threat. The goal of the course is to familiarize students with the influence of strategy, technology, organizations, psychology, ideology, and economics on the nature of this threat and the strategies for managing this danger. The course is organized into three parts. The first part of the course provides a theoretical and historical framework for analyzing the likelihood of WMD terrorism. This section will examine methodologies for assessing risk and the ongoing debate about the capabilities and motives of terrorists to acquire and use WMD. Case studies of terrorists groups that have sought these weapons, as well as those who have not, will be studied. The second part examines how terrorists could acquire and use nuclear, biological, chemical, and radiological weapons. The incentives for and obstacles to terrorist acquisition and use of each of these types of weapons will be considered in turn. The third part of the course covers the range of policy tools available to national and international authorities to manage the threat of WMD terrorism such as intelligence and law enforcement, prevention and deterrence, and crisis and consequence management. Special consideration will be given to how political and economic factors influence homeland security programs. This section will include a simulated National Security Council (NSC) meeting to respond to a WMD terrorism scenario. International perspectives on preventing and preparing for WMD terrorism preparedness will also be examined.

    :number: "001"
    :description: This Introduction to Sociology course examines basic sociological concepts, theories, and methodologies by focusing on the substantive topics of community and alienation. We look at how different kinds of social change, social structures, social institutions, and interaction affect opportunities, social conditions, and relationships in groups and in society at large. Specific indicators of community and alienation are defined and applied in class discussion and research projects. Although most data are based on U.S. experiences, some comparative data from varied cultural and historical settings will also be used. Attention will be focused on how the living conditions of all members of society can be improved. Hierarchical authority structures and rigid divisions of labor in communities may increase alienation, and alienation may create new communities. Strategies to intervene effectively in disadvantaged communities--in order to ameliorate problematic social conditions--will be discussed and designed. Small group projects (see detailed description below) may include field work in Washington D.C. Local community organizations are possible sites or topics for research on particular aspects of community or alienation, as well as more traditional library projects. Life history data may also be used to show how individuals are integrated in or alienated from specific social groups and mainstream society.

    :description: This course will introduce you to a variety of current social problems in the United States and it will help you develop critical and sociological thinking through the analysis of these issues. The course uses popular media as well as sociological materials to examine a range of issues, including but not limited to race, class, gender, crime, and inequality. Many of these topics are closely intertwined, so you will find throughout the semester that we will return to issues already discussed, approaching these issues from a somewhat different angle. We will examine human behaviors and social conditions that violate the dominant norms and values in society or that represent potential threats to the general quality of life. Much of the material presented in this course will challenge your values and beliefs since adopting a sociological perspective entails looking at the world from a different vantage point than the one you typically use. Whether your ideas ultimately change or remain the same, this course should help you clarify why you believe what you believe, help you understand the implications and consequences of those beliefs and help you to compare your perceptions with empirical studies of the social world.

The definition of death, medical technology-induced social issues; society's response to death; dying process and dying setting; social interaction patterns during the dying experience, and near-death experiences are examined by applying sociology principles and analytical evidence to these phenomena. The student should develop an understanding about how to apply sociological knowledge to current social situations, to develop a clearer understanding of the social situation, and to formulate policy as a result of evaluating the evidence. Some practical advice about the death and dying experience is also given.

We will explore the history of religion as a concept in social philosophy and its incorporation into the field of sociology. In addition we will study the new sociology of religion theorists, particularly the research of cultural and civil society rituals and practices as religious phenomena. After laying the theoretical groundwork for religion and society, we will learn how to analyze religious phenomena in different case studies. In so doing we will also learn how different methodologies such as ethnographic field work, community-based research projects, interview and focus group strategies, quantitative and web-based technologies, and social histories help us critically analyze the interface of religion and society. Students will be encouraged to be involved in community-based research throughout the semester (fourth credit option). In 2006 the community-based research groups will have the following foci: 1) Washington, DC \xE2\x80\x9Cfaith-based\xE2\x80\x9D organizations that focus on American social issues; and 2) religion and society in the Latino and Latin American communities.

We will investigate what and who creates these categories, how they are constructed, and some explanations as to why these categories are created. To aid in this exploration, the concept of critical thinking will be emphasized and you will be introduced to the social construction theory. To fully understand the process of transforming difference into inequality, the interrelationships between systems of oppression will be examined. We will examine the role various social institutions--such as the family, education, the economy, the state, and the media--play in creating and maintaining systems of stratification based on the construction of difference. The role of ideology in maintaining inequality by endorsing the interests of the dominant group is also discussed. Finally, we will examine how people working within individual and institutional contexts transform systems of oppression and privilege into a system of equal access to opportunity. Various aspects of social change will be explored, including the factors and sources that precipitate such change.

After discussing the socially constructed and problematic nature of racial categorization, we will focus on how race and racism is learned. We will trace how racial difference is created and eventually generates socially segregated patterns by adolescence, which in turn become solidified in adulthood. We will then explore, in detail, racism and privilege as systemic, institutionalized features of U.S. society. In particular, we will examine how modern racism has been coded and masked itself in seemingly race-neutral, color-blind language and practices. In doing so, we will translate the subtle racial meanings of this code. We will then look at how this color-blind racism, coupled with structural obstacles in arenas such as housing, the education system, the economy and job market, and the criminal justice system, help to maintain racial inequality.

Social intelligence is the degree of awareness individuals and groups have about the complexity and predictability of diverse social forms and processes. Sociological theories used in these analyses emphasize differences among social classes, inequalities in power relations, social institutions, social systems, and contrasting cultural styles and viewpoints. We give particular attention to the influence of increased diversity in the U.S. and the world. We also question the extent to which a learned social intelligence and collective action can ameliorate problematic social conditions and increase social justice.

On the other hand, we will also consider how the state's activities in turn can shape the social order. The second axis of distinction involves what sociologists call levels of analysis. We will spend the first part of the course \"looking up\" at the political system from the individual's point of view, in particular the individual in civil society who is a member of different social groups and categories: class, race and ethnic group, gender, religion, and other interest groups. Later, however, we will spend some time analyzing, at the macro level, entire political systems: \"looking down\" at the origins and persistence of states, and at the determinants and consequences of democratic, authoritarian, and totalitarian types of political regimes. Among the topics to be considered are: various paradigms in political sociology; the role of ideology; social correlates of voting; political elites; the state and its apparatuses; democracy and democratization; and poltical crises, including revolutions."

Globalization and Social Change in Developing Countries (3) Professor Mashayekhi The general purpose of this course is to provide students with a historical, theoretical, and empirical discussion of the globalization process in developing countries (\"Third World\"). In particular, there will be a focus on the political and cultural dimensions of globalism since World War II. By \"globalization\" we refer to a significant intensification of economic, political, and cultural linkages between nations and regions of the world, and a corresponding consciousness about this process. Globalization, during the last several decades, has had two contradictory effects on non-Western cultures: homogenization, leading to cultural integration and increased similarities; and differentiation, promoting cultural resistance and the formation of nationalistic/nativistic identities. If pro-democracy movements in many contemporary developing countries represent the former, the cases of national liberation movements, Islamic revivalism, and newer ethnic-nationalism represent the latter. In other words, how people in these societies have come to define their national identities in reference to the \"other,\" i.e., the West, after World War II. While the general concept in this course will be globalization, a range of relevant concepts such as national identity, Third Worldism, dependency, modernization/modernism, democratization and civil society, human rights and feminism will also be discussed."

We will then study the social and cultural organization of the scientific community as such, including the laboratory setting where science is done; the social organization of scientists into departments and "invisible colleges"; the cultural standards, rewards, and ambivalences of scientists; deviance and fraud; and social inequalities among scientists. Next we consider how "scientific revolutions" occur (or not, as in "cold fusion") in various fields, including recent attempts by SSK, feminists, and post-modern theorists to revolutionize our understanding of science. Finally, we will examine how the relations between science and the rest of the social order can nurture or inhibit its institutional advances. Especially in this last section, but not only here, we will draw on comparative and/ or historical materials, not just studies of American science. (Not offered 2004-05)

  - :name: "Managing Risky Technologies: Sociological Perspectives"
    :number: "176"
    :description: Sociologists vitally debate the feasibility of safely managing risky technologies such as nuclear power plants, recombinant biologicals, space vehicles and the Internet. "High Reliability" theorists offer an optimistic perspective. While acknowledging the structural difficulties of managing complex technological systems, they argue that strong leadership, continuous training and practice, and redundant safety mechanisms create cultures of safety that prevent catastrophic accidents. "Normal Accident" theorists present pessimistic assessments arguing that complex, tightly coupled systems inevitably produce system accidents that are difficult if not impossible for human operators to manage. This course will study key texts in this debate and major case studies such as the Chernobyl and Black Hawk shootdown accidents. Students will select a "risky technology" for detailed analysis in light of the debate.

    :number: "181"
    :description: This course is a general introduction to the sociological analysis of Aotearoa/New Zealand society. It offers an opportunity to place New Zealand in both historical and contemporary contexts and to explore where New Zealand is positioned on the global stage. The course focuses on the structure of New Zealand society, its current social and political dynamics, and the way that these shape the present. From a mono-cultural culture (Maori) to the present multi-cultural state a unique society has emerged that must deal with both the struggles and opportunities that this shift creates. Through studies of colonization, ethnic/cultural identities and issues, the economy, state, class relations, the position of women, immigration, media, law, and community we begin to tease out the way that these issues are addressed and to explore the different futures New Zealand could have.

A brief overview of pre-contact New Zealand; a brief overview of settlement and colonial policies, land alienation, and the Treaty of Waitangi; the historical welfare state in New Zealand; restructuring and social policy since 1984; the 1988 Royal Commission on Social Policy; bicultural/multi-cultural policy orientations; health, justice, education, family, labour market, and immigration policies; central and local government engagement; addressing inequalities and "closing the gaps." We consider these topics so as to familiarize students with the characteristics of New Zealand social policy and to gain a sense of the way social policy reflects, informs, challenges, and articulates the diverse experiences of modern New Zealand life. Which concepts and categories are central to current debates? What are the relationships between the historic welfare state and social policy today? How can students come to a rigorous examination of social change today? How are notions of social justice understood by "targeted groups" like the Maori and Pasefika communities? Have social policies actually changed such inequalities? In what ways? Fall.

Students perform statistical analyses of real data sets (including the General Social Survey, the major database for social scientists) with a user-friendly statistical package (an individual copy of which comes with each textbook). Homework problems are regularly assigned. For the purpose of giving some substantive continuity to the course, students will read some brief excerpts on the debate about multi-culturalism, translate the terms of that debate into empirical propositions that can be tested with the data and run analyses testing their propositions.

    :description: Institutionalized, "science-based" medicine has dominated health care in the United States for the last one hundred years. Alternatives and criticisms of "official medicine" have nonetheless always existed. In recent years, many orthodox and unorthodox groups have made strong, public demands for reform in the practice and financing of health care. This course will examine a range of these processes including the original development of institutionalized medicine, the significance of "alternative" medicines such as faith healing, critiques of medical practice as experienced by patients, disregard of medical estimates of "risky" behavior, and the emergence of "discretionary healthcare." Examples come from the life of a man rendered paraplegic from spine cancer, snake-handlers in Appalachia, black teenagers in urban America, and plastic surgery. This course will interest students concerned with health policy, the practice of healthcare and applications of sociological theory to medical issues. Fall.

We will consider Brazil via a number of issues and topics familiar to anyone who has taken an introductory sociology course, but obviously with a different national focus. After initial brief coverage of Brazil\xE2\x80\x99s geography and history, we will consider the following Brazilian topics: population and patterns of demographic change, including family planning; cultural institutions such as the family (with attention to norms and ethnic intermarriage patterns), religions (including the African-derived and the Protestant), the economy (including foreign influences and recent restructuring), politics (including recent democratization and related matters); education and its inequalities; sports; et al. Next we will examine ultural norms and values, and deviance from those norms, including patterns of crime and of criminal justice. In considering social organization, we will consider patterns of face-to-face social relationships (including networks and clientelism) and of regional and urban/rural residence. Next we will study patterns of inequality--including a good deal of attention to social class and mobility, to gender, and to racial & ethnic relations (especially the last). Finally we will consider Brazilian movements for social and political change. This course is also offered for MA Students in the CLAS Program with a LASP 400-level course-number. Spring."

The concept of \xE2\x80\x9Cglobalization\xE2\x80\x9D came into public attention in the 1990\xE2\x80\x99s and was defined by one theorist as \xE2\x80\x9Ca social process in which the constraints of geography on social and cultural arrangements recede and in which people become increasingly aware that they are receding.\xE2\x80\x9D Globalization process is typically traced through three arenas of social life, namely: the economy, the polity, and the culture. The focus of the course is on the latter two, specifically in countries of Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Globalization has created a more unified and systematic place, however that does not imply a more harmonious world. Alongside other forces of \xE2\x80\x9Chomogenization\xE2\x80\x99, one also finds the forces of \xE2\x80\x9Cdifferentiation\xE2\x80\x9D an resistance. This resistance to globalization, or at times to its western-orientation, has taken diverse forms: nationalism, environmentalism, religious revivalism/fundamentalism, movements against the World Bank and the I.M.F. and even radical democratic movements. The real goal of this course is, therefore, to critically examine various definitions, characterizations, and evaluations of the globalization process. The course is divided into three main sections: A) General theoretical framework for analyzing \xE2\x80\x9CThird World,\xE2\x80\x9D B) Conceptualizing globalization; and C) Middle Eastern Politics in the age of globalization."

  - :name: Sociology of Terrorism
    :number: "285"
    :description: "This course focuses on terrorism from a sociology perspective. Sociology is the study of human social interaction and structure in groups. Sociologists examine systematically the ways people behave and arrange themselves in groups. Why people behave and organize the ways they do. We tend to take the behavior and structure for granted, since we are part of the group, but our perspective is clouded by what we have been taught to believe. By systematically observing and analyzing both the group interactions and the group structures, sociologists can describe, explain, and interpret the group behavior patterns, and explain the influences of the social structure on that behavior. Sociology\xE2\x80\x99s companion field, Anthropology, adds the critical dimension of culture to the understanding of human behavior. Sociology\xE2\x80\x99s structure/functional, interaction, and critical theories have been very useful in understanding social issues, and have been very influential in deciding social policy issues: sometimes beneficially, sometimes not so well. Sociology of Terrorism takes a deviance and social control approach to the concept, theories, structure, and control of terrorism. A concept of many meanings and applications, the first section of the course will examine the social construct of the concept, terrorism, from several social and cultural perspectives. The second component of the course will examine theories of terrorism from the traditional functional/structural, conflict, and interaction theories. The first is the theoretical approach normally applied by governments, the second is the classic argument used by terrorist groups, while the third theory focuses on the protagonists and the victims. Part three will focus on the current state of terrorism, and part four on the current debate about controlling terrorism. The method is lecture participation, and discussion.

Readings for the course will certainly include general theoretical statements about development from a number of perspectives, but will strive always to situate such theories within the real experiences of the peoples of the Americas over half a millennium. Since most of the writings on these matters dwell on the past century (or two), so will our attention, but we will still consider writings, evidence, and arguments that cover the entire period, from first colonization up to the most recent decade or two.

    :description: "Scope of Course All students must have completed Introduction to Sociology before enrolling in Advanced Research Seminar: Family Patterns. This intellectual foundation is an invaluable source of some of the basic sociological concepts, theories, and research methods which will be used in Family Patterns. The focus of the Family Patterns seminar, \"family patterns,\" derives from William J. Goode's classic monograph, World Revolution and Family Patterns, 1963. In this work Goode's family patterns describe and explain a wide range of intergenerational family processes and related social changes throughout history and among contrasting cultures. This kind of broad approach is taken in Advanced Research Seminar: Family Patterns in order to include a wide variety of theories and research methodologies which have deepened our understanding of diversity in families, as well as the different interests of students who will undertake substantial family research projects throughout the semester. Advanced Research Seminar: Family Patterns is built on two existing Department courses: Family Interaction, a micro-sociological study of intergenerational family interaction (Hall teaches two sections of this course every two years, with a maximum enrollment of 25+25 students); and Family and Society, a macro-sociological, institutional analysis of family changes (which Hall taught last in Fall 1999, with a maximum enrollment of 45 students). The Advanced Research Seminar: Family Patterns integrates micro- and macro-studies of individual and social behavior within three generation families and between families and family institutions. Particular attention is given to the wide range of family forms and family negotiations created by the major social influences of gender, race, ethnicity, culture, social class, the global economy, politics, religions, education, and history. This advanced research seminar deepens our intellectual and sociological understanding of diverse families, as well as heightens our awareness of some of the social justice issues related to the optimal conditions and considerations of family well-being. The discipline of sociology is presented as a useful means to understand families, as well as a way to conceptualize family problem-solving ventures in individual, family, community, and societal settings. Sociological research findings about families suggest directions for social policies and social movements, and inform the design of national and international social interventions. Because of these study objectives, Family Patterns creates opportunities for sociology majors and other interested students to consider family studies and family concerns as professional career choices."

The course will meet as a weekly seminar to discuss readings and to develop students' research projects. Students' research will focus on social justice issues such as health care, housing, education, economic development, education, and violence prevention. These projects will be developed collaboratively with a community partner, in consultation with the professor. A number of projects will be suggested, but students are also allowed to develop their own projects (for example, with community service programs with which they already work). The research projects should be related to the organization or agency's social change, policy, or program goals. The course begins with a brief overview of the problem areas, principles, and practices of community-based research, and potential sites. The student, professor, and site supervisors will work out the details of the student's placement during the first two weeks of the course. Students will be expected to conduct research, produce policy option/position papers, and possibly arrange workshops for policy-makers, academics, and interested community partners. Students are expected to work with the community organization one day per week (80 hours per semester).

    :description: We can now live in Sao Paolo and communicate instantly with people in Chicago. We can sit in a room in countries as far flung as Indonesia and Germany and watch MTV. Software engineers in Bangalore , India do business in Silicon Valley, California. With increasing technology binding us ever closer, and economic networks making it increasingly necessary for us to communicate with each other as a world community we need to examine the nature of the phenomena of globalization and the role of religion and ideology in the world today. Is globalization just a cliche for our times, an expression of the current 'Zeitgeist', or could it be used as an analytical tool to better understand the profound and rapid changes in the world order that we are currently witnessing? What kind of changes does the globalization process imply for the development of democracy, for sovereignty, and economic progress? And how can we influence this process towards inclusion instead of marginalization, towards enhanced democracy instead of uncontrolled market dominance? The course will specifically examine the phenomenon of globalization through the twin lenses of India and of Hinduism. India! is par ticularly appropriate since it is the largest democracy in the world and Hinduism has spread far and wide through the Indian Hindu diaspora.The course will deal with a range of material on globalization and global culture, bringing to the foreground current debates on transformation of religion in diasporic communities, cultural flows, de-territorialization, the rise of nationalism, and the role of religion in the globalizing world. This course intends to provide the student with a broad based view of the wide range of opinions and debates prevalent about globalization today. Thus there will emphasis on many apparently divergent phenomena, with students encouraged to question the nature of relation between these phenomena.

Our focus will be on Spanish texts and their place within the wider literary and cultural tradition of medieval allegory. Readings from Augustine, Isidore of Seville, Boethius, Maimonides, and Alan of Lille will pave the way for our interpretations of vernacular works from the Iberian Peninsula, including El libro de buen amor, Raz\xC3\xB3n de Amor, Laberinto de fortuna, Visi\xC3\xB3n delectable, and Siervo Libre de Amor. These Spanish works will be studied in their intellectual, historical and cultural contexts and in relation to works in other vernaculars such as the The Divine Comedy, Romance of the Rose, and The Book of the City of Ladies. The class will be conducted in short lectures, student presentations, and extended group discussions (both in class and via Blackboard). Student responsibilities include active participation in class discussion, one bibliographic presentation, and a final research paper (10-15 pp for undergrads and 20-30 for graduate students). Students will be encouraged to apply the class's study of allegory to works in their own literatures and periods of interest in their final projects.

Instructed SLA can be defined as empirical efforts to investigate the potential effects of exposure to or instruction of targeted linguistic items in the input on learners? Second/foreign language (L2) development. This area of research subsumes several strands of empirical classroom-based studies that include focus on form, processing instruction, interaction, implicit vs. explicit learning conditions, classroom-based tasks, input/textual enhancement, and attention to form and meaning. Other key issues in this course on classroom language acquisition will include current theoretical models and hypotheses that provide the theoretical underpinnings of most instructed SLA studies, aptitude and learning styles, the nature of interlanguage, and other cognitive accounts of SLA.

    :number: "527"
    :description: After a brief introduction to the philosophy and methods of generative grammar, this course examines some of the basic aspects of modern syntactic theory. It starts with an in depth discussion of the need for postulating syntactic structures and then moves on to examine how best to account for phenomena such as word order variation, the distribution and referential properties of noun phrases, and the differences among clausal types. These phenomena will be analyzed mainly through the insights offered by the Principles and Parameters framework. The course consists of lecture presentations, class discussion and intensive problem solving and argumentation on the part of the students. In addition to the Tuesday-Thursday lectures, it comprises a weekly discussion session led by the Teaching Asssistant; this provides an opportunity for students to ask further clarification questions, go over issues that one might feel were not covered in sufficient detail in class, and discuss the weekly homework assignments. LING/SPAN 527 is the first segment of a two-semester sequence which aims to familiarize the students with the assumptions, goals and methodology of generative syntax, while also providing them the opportunity to explore a few topics in some depth through readings from the primary literature. The second semester course will discuss the relation between the Principles & Parameters and the Minimalist framework.

Our focus will be on evolving societal concerns as depicted by Spanish America\xE2\x80\x99s foremost playwrights. We will begin with El gesticulador, Rodolfo Usigli\xE2\x80\x99s biting expos\xC3\xA9 of Mexican corruption in post-Revolutionary Mexico, a play considered so provocative that it was banned by the government. We will go on to examine other portrayals of Latin American society that highlight themes of continuing relevance: poverty, discrimination, violence, sexual inequality, and AIDs. Ren\xC3\xA9 Marqu\xC3\xA9s brings to the stage the plight of rural Puerto Ricans who migrate to seek a better life. Other plays reflect the social turmoil of mid-century, for example, Jos\xC3\xA9 Triana\xE2\x80\x99s dramatic fantasy on repression and rebellion and Egon Wolff\xE2\x80\x99s depiction of the complacency of Chile\xE2\x80\x99s upper middle class and its inevitable consequences. Manuel Puig sets his Beso de la mujer ara\xC3\xB1a against the backdrop of military repression in Argentina, a theme also explored by A\xC3\xADda Bornik. Several plays deal with sexuality, homosexuality and changing roles of women (Puig, Chocr\xC3\xB3n, Bortnik, Ott, Berman). Jorge Di\xC3\xA1z\xE2\x80\x99s Cepillo de dientes explores problems of incommunication in societies dominated by technology. Mario Vargas Llosa examines the creative process in his portrayal of a young writer struggling to produce his first book, while Isaac Chocr\xC3\xB3n brings a Jewish perspective to his portrayal of a man coming to terms with AIDS, death and faith. Mario Bencastro\xE2\x80\x99s play, La encrucijada, is a portrayal of modern existential crisis. We will examine these plays not only as written texts, but as playable scripts, exploring possible implications for staging. Students will read articles on performance theory and spectator response theory. Whenever possible, we will watch live plays, videotaped performances, and film adaptations.

We will explore the burgeoning literary consciousness of the sixteenth century, the importance of Italian models, poetic experimentation, the explosion of mystical writing, the development of the novella and the full-length novel, and the flowering of Spanish theater. We will approach the texts from both literary and cultural perspectives. We will read pertinent criticism and consider how changing approaches to literature influence how early modern texts are read. Among the topics we will explore are how the discovery of texts by women alters our view of early modern Spain and how performance theory has revolutionized the study of the Spanish comedia. We will also consider the effects on literary production of religious and political repression and economic developments such as the birth of the book industry.

  - :name: Awareness and SLA
    :number: "499"
    :description: The role of consciousness and awareness in the human attentional system while learning has been particularly controversial in the fields of cognitive psychology, cognitive science, and second language acquisition. More specifically, there is considerable controversy regarding the role of awareness at the level of noticing (Schmidt, 2001; Robinson, 1995) or detection (Tomlin & Villa, 1994) in L2 learning. This controversy is further compounded by two methodological problems in addressing the role of awareness in language learning, namely, defining precisely what constitutes awareness and operationalizing or measuring awareness. In this seminar we will review these issues of awareness in learning in both non-SLA and SLA fields and conduct a data-based research project that will address the role of awareness in SLA.

    :description: Colonial Latin America was characterized by a multiethnic social formation whose nature cannot adequately be comprehended through recourse to notions of "hybridity," "syncretism," or "acculturation," concepts which tend to polarize ethnic membership and forms of ethnic activity, and which derive from the examination of other, later colonial projects. This course will examine a broad range of historical writings on interethnic communication in Mesoamerica and the Andes, also focusing on key texts written by colonial indigenous and mestizo actors, in an attempt to begin to theorize what colonial culture means in the Latin American context.

    :description: "This course will examine colonial texts and their modern renderings into narrative or film. We will analyze and discuss the different points of view and experiences of the New World represented in chronicles of the XV to the XVII centuries. Concurrently we will study the re-envisionings and reworkings of these texts into films and novels produced in the twentieth century. We will focus our discussions in the particular factors that inform the written as well as the visual texts. We will reflect on the historical moment and the cultural milieu in which these visual and written texts emerge, considering the ideologies that underlie them, and we will analyze the role that all these elements play in the production as well as in the reception of these cultural objects. Among the topics to be discussed in class are the problems of representation, writing vs. Orality, the role of religion, politics and power, and history vs. fiction. Among the texts, novels and films that we will study are Columbus's Diary together with 1492, Dir. Ridley Scott. 1992, Alvar Nu?ez Cabeza de Vaca - Naufragios with Cabeza de Vaca. Dir.

    :description: "Over the course of a student\xE2\x80\x99s business education, much attention will be devoted to mastering business strategy\xE2\x80\x93the techniques that enable managers to exploit market opportunities to more effectively realize the goals of the firm. Unfortunately, strategy courses rarely instruct the student on the limitations on the use of these techniques imposed by modern criminal law. Business Crimes is designed to fill this gap by acquainting the student with the fundamentals of the federal law of white collar crime. Business Crimes focuses on the general provisions of the criminal law that apply to business conduct. Some of the provisions that will be covered include the standard for corporate criminal liability, the federal fraud offenses, conspiracy, money laundering, RICO, obstruction of justice, perjury, false statements, and the United States Sentencing Commission\xE2\x80\x99s Organizational Sentencing Guidelines. The course will also explore the impact of Federal Department of Justice policy on managerial decision-making, as well as those aspects of criminal procedure especially relevant to business such as the corporate attorney-client privilege. Finally, the course will highlight the challenges compliance with the law of white collar crime presents for the ethical business person. Business Crimes will not address violations of particular regulatory statutes, although, time-permitting, some more specific offenses, e.g. insider trading, may be considered. Please note that Business Crimes is a rigorous course designed to develop the student\xE2\x80\x99s ability to recognize and analyze the legal issues that confront the contemporary business person. To do so, it will employ the \xE2\x80\x9Claw school\xE2\x80\x9D case method, in which students read actual legal decisions in order to extract the principles of law that they contain. Students will be evaluated on the basis of not merely of their knowledge of the rules of law, but on their ability to use this knowledge to resolve or avoid the type of legal problems that they may incur in their future careers in business. Business Crimes is an interesting and challenging course that is of value to anyone considering a career in business in these post-Enron days, and can be especially valuable to those considering law school following graduation."

More broadly, students will explore how Shakespeare\xE2\x80\x99s plays offer a uniquely encompassing vision of theatre as a potent agent of historical, cultural, psychological, philosophical, spiritual, and socio-political knowledge. As performers, students will develop an understanding of textual rhythms in both verse and prose -- including techniques of scansion -- as well as emotional, interpretive, physical, and vocal techniques, with a goal of achieving immediacy, clarity and freshness in Shakespearean performance."

From chaos monsters like Leviathan and Behemoth, to God's terrifying nighttime attack on Moses in Exodus 4, to the beast with seven heads and ten horns in the book of Revelation--the Bible often reads more like horror literature than religious literature. In this course we will explore why that might be. That is, what might religion and horror (or the monstrous) have in common, and how finally do they differ? Why does the horror genre draw so often on biblical and religious themes (as in Dracula's favorite quote from the book of Leviticus, "the life is in the blood")? And is the supernatural a necessary part of religion, or can religion exist within the bounds of reason alone? The class will engage in close readings of selected biblical texts, and move on to Gothic literature and modern films. A good deal of writing and reading will be required.

    :description: "The church honors as martyrs those Christian men and women who refused to deny their faith and thus were \xE2\x80\x9Cthrown to the lions\xE2\x80\x9D by the Roman emperors. This same church anathematizes as heretics those men and women it had burned at the stake in medieval Europe. And, although Nestorius was condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431, the church in Persia reveres him as an orthodox teacher. While the punishments for heresy in the Latin west could be quite dramatic, the complexities in identifying 'heresy' are particularly evident when Christians from different traditions come into contact with one another \xE2\x80\x93 as in the Christological controversies in the early church, or during the Crusades, and afterwards, in Ottoman and colonial times. In an effort to unravel the historical, socio-political and theological difficulties in defining 'heresy' and 'true' martyrdom, this course presents a comparative overview of the evolution of Christian doctrine and social realities in the (Hellenized) Latin and Semitic worlds. Course discussions will center on the testimonies and eyewitness accounts of Christian martyrs, as well as the writings of, and invectives against, key 'heresiarchs'."

This course offers a detailed and nuanced look at the Islamic legal methodology and its evolution over the last 1400 years.

From there, the course will follow a chronological overview of the historical development of Tibetan Buddhism from the seventh century to the present day. Themes considered during the second half of the course include ethics, ritual, art, sacred geography, and biographical literature. Readings will consist of primary texts in translation supplemented by secondary literature on the study of religion and Tibetan Buddhism."

  - :name: The Hindu Religious Tradition
    :number: "057"
    :description: Hinduism is a vast world of ideas and practices--often paradoxical and bewildering--that have spanned millennia. A host of gods attracts the devotions of worshipers, but a single Cosmic Principle draws the unwavering concentration of the mystic. Popular rituals and magical practices reside alongside mind-splitting subtleties of philosophical speculation. This introductory course will focus on a few basic themes that lend a sense of unity to the puzzle of Hinduism. We shall look at the ancient ritual and philosophical texts of the Vedas and Upanishads, survey medieval reformist movements and their foundation in devotional religion, observe the practice of religion in rural India, and uncover the religious origins of Gandhi's political philosophy, among other themes.

    :description: This course explores the sources, methods, disputes and insights of Christian ethics. Central themes and issues include freedom, conscience and the passions, the relation of God and morality, love and justice, virtue and law, and the question whether there is a distinctive Christian ethics.

According to this theory, then, autobiographies are religious per se, by offering, as Lynda Sexson says, ways of imagining ourselves. This course will examine a variety of autobiographies in order to see more clearly the principles of selection (what is presented as the "life"?), the forms the lives are given (narrative? poetic? dramatic?), and the consequences of the choices made. Attention will also be paid to how the class members conceive of their own autobiographies--the shapes of their own lives.

    :description: Much of the way we live our lives and the way we reflect on our lives is disconnected. On a national level, debates rage about the war in Iraq, health care, evolution and creation. On a personal level, we wonder which major to choose, how to spend our money, whom to befriend. Constantly we are called upon to make decisions. And the consequences are enormous. But how do we decide? With the heart or with the mind? Caring about myself or the world? Through science or faith? Experience or authority? Whether we understand them or not, there are reasons for our decisions, reasons that tend to be grounded historically in some school of thought. This course will seek to identify and integrate positions offered by such thinkers as Thomas Aquinas, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Luther, Ignatius Loyola, Marx, Kierkegaard, Nietzsche, and Bernard Lonergan, SJ.

  - :name: Portraits of Paul in the New Testament
    :number: "163"
    :description: Not long after St. Paul penned his letters they were already the subject of debate and disagreement. The author of 2 Peter says of them, that they contain things that are hard to understand, and that some people have twisted their meaning to exploit their own interests (3:15-16). In the end, the New Testament itself contains a variety of portraits of Paul. These portraits comprise the one found in his authentic letters, the depiction of Paul by Luke in the Acts of the Apostles, and the picture of Paul in the deutero-Pauline and non-Pauline letters. This course recovers the various portraits of Paul in the New Testament, in an effort to understand the complexity of this towering figure in early Christianity and the legacy he left behind.

In the second half of the course, the focus shifts to the ways in which Muslim jurists have responded to issues of contemporary importance/controversy, ranging from gender equity (in marriage, divorce, economic rights) to medical ethics (abortion, euthanasia, organ donation, female circumcision).

  - :name: Religion as Writing/Writing as Religion
    :number: "277"
    :description: Among the elements of culture that shape religion and that can, indeed, be religious, one of the more powerful is writing. Whether we consider writing in the most conventional sense as the manner in which our texts are composed through genre, diction, imagery, and voice; or we look at writing as the deconstructive critics do, as a crucial absence that lies within presence; or, finally, as the physicality contained in all of our expressions, whether they are on paper or not; it seems evident that all explicitly religious expressions are forms of writing. The nature of the religious vision of a work can be greatly elucidated by examining the writing that it contains. Moreover, some of the more subtle and important manifestations of religion are contained in the writings (in all three senses) that don't seem to be religious at all, but that perform the religious function, nonetheless, of providing humans with orientation in their lives. This upper level elective in the Religion and Culture concentration will read theoretical essays by Jacques Derrida, Mark Taylor, Michel Foucault, and Hayden White, as well as fiction by Jorge Luis Borges, Virginia Woolf, and others in order to make sense of the many relations that exist between religion and writing.

    :number: "279"
    :description: Modern inquiry into politics and justice coincides with the rise of social theory, the rational investigation into the structure and processes of social institutions. The erosion of religious faith in the modern period has often been attributed, at least in part, to the understanding of religion advanced in classical social theory (Weber, Durkheim, Dilthey, Marx). While the course will examine these challenges, the emphasis will fall upon the positive contribution classical social theory has made to theological developments, particularly in theological ethics, in the twentieth century.

Central focus will be on primary texts, read with an eye toward their historical, cultural, and geographical context. The course is divided into three parts: (1) Middle Ages. We shall begin with the twelfth-century renaissance, when cross- fertilization among Muslim, Jewish, and Christian scholars gave rise to new ways of doing Christian theology; we will study scholasticism and medieval mysticism. We shall also study the Crusades (the motivating factors, how they functioned in the imagination and piety of medieval Christian culture, their political and spiritual effects) and the fall of Constantinople in 1453. (2) Reformation. We shall study the Protestant and Catholic Reformations of the sixteenth century, studying not only the theology but also the social and political repercussions. We shall start with precursors to the reformation and then focus in particular on Martin Luther, John Calvin, the Council of Trent, and Ignatius of Loyola. (3) The Modern Period. We shall focus on problems of articulating Christian faith in the context of the modern world, its view of history, which seems inconsistent with revelation; its scientific methods; and its emphasis on the individual and individual rights."

As did that of Thomas Aquinas for many generations, Rahner\xE2\x80\x99s theology now commonly serves as an authoritative point of reference for theologians in the Roman Catholic community and, as well, an important reference for some theologians of other Christian denominations. The course will begin with Rahner\xE2\x80\x99s fundamental analysis of the human person\xE2\x80\x99s relation to God and proceed through his treatment of revelation, faith, Christ, church, sacrament, spirituality and fundamental ethics. It should be noted that Rahner\xE2\x80\x99s writing makes serious demands and would not please a facile or faint hearted reader."

    :description: "The formation of religious identity in China has never been a matter of making exclusive choices. To be sure, the explicit tensions and competitions between the \xE2\x80\x9Cthree teachings\xE2\x80\x9D as originally formulated in China have laid out distinct ritual, moral, and metaphysical choices. Careful examination of both doctrinal and social practices, however, reveals the degree to which a putatively discrete formation (such as \xE2\x80\x9CBuddhism\xE2\x80\x9D) takes on definition and meaning only in a pluralistic context. The Asian practice of inhabiting different religious identities in accord with social context and individual evolution is instructive of how all religious communities evolve, even in historical contexts where the discourse of monotheism and religious exclusivity prevail. This course will examine illustrative moments in the Chinese pluralistic context: The formation of Confucian and Daoist discourses; Daoist and Buddhist syncretism; and the evolution of Confucian and Buddhist polemics. To balance these primarily discursive contexts, we will also pay heed to the impact of Buddhism, as a foreign religion, on the cultural practices of China."

Its focus is not on how to respond to discrete acts of injustice, but on how to help societies to seek the emerging opportunity of peace when it presents itself by seizing the moment and building on lessons learned from the destructive legacies of a violent past. What does the Catholic tradition have to say about actual acts of human destructiveness and about building a just order? What role do forgiveness and apology play? What role can the Church play? What relevance does this role have for politics? The course is unusual in giving students the opportunity to develop, not merely to study, a topic.

The basis and substance of the study will be Dante's Commedia. The approach of the course to this theme will be interdisciplinary with significant consideration being given to the function of imagination as it operates in poetry, psychology, philosophy, and theology. The unifying element in this approach would be the role of metaphor in all these disciplines, with special attention to both the similarities and the specific difference of that role in each as it appears in the poem. We will read in translation and discuss substantial portions of all three of the Cantiche of the Commedia, Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso. Students will be asked to make regular use of a website designed specifically for this course incorporating the text of the Commedia in Italian and English translation, as well as images from the rich history of the illustration of the poem by great artists and commentary on the text from a variety of sources. No prior expertise in web technology is required; students will, however, be asked to become familiar with and use a few basic techniques of interactive, web-based learning. 2.

    :description: Ancient social relations were governed by the conventions of friendship and enmity and their corresponding ethics. Consequently, pervasive attitudes towards friendship played an important role in the daily lives of ancient peoples in the Greco-Roman world. Early Christians, as engaged citizens of the ancient world, understood the role friendship played in the society of their day and developed their own perspectives on its importance in their own social relations. The purpose of this course is (1) to understand ancient notions of friendship as reflected in the thought of Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Epicureans, and later popular Hellenistic moral philosophers and (2) to appreciate how early Christians appropriated Greco-Roman friendship traditions and adapted them to the needs of their communities. The course focuses on the ethics of friendship in the writings of Paul, Luke, and John, and probes the implications for a contemporary understanding of friends and friendship. (Not offered 2005-06)

    :description: "It\xE2\x80\x99s a commonplace that the civil law is built on morality; for the average citizen, the law creates a moral society. But everywhere one turns today, there are conflicts between religious and moral values and legal regulations: the gay marriage debate, sodomy laws, blue laws, faith-based initiatives. What should we make of these conflicts? Are the forces of secularization and liberal values corroding the religious and moral foundations of civil law? Or are the intersections of law, morality, and religion historically much more complicated, sometimes intersecting and overlapping but fundamentally different? What is the role of religion in the law and political structure of the United States? Does freedom of religion mean freedom from religion? How have (and should) the laws of the United States protect religious freedom while regulating conduct in society? Is the legal regulation of social and moral codes legally defensible? In this course, our aim will be to uncover some of the answers to these questions. We\xE2\x80\x99ll address classic authors of moral and political theory (such as Aquinas, Locke, and Mill) side-by-side with modern legal cases, such as the formative Supreme Court decisions about freedom of religion, and cases about the legal regulation of moral norms, as in Lawrence v. Texas (the recent case about sodomy). We shall see the development of theories about the relation of religion, law, and morality (the relation of Church and State). We\xE2\x80\x99ll read how the Courts in the United States have struggled with these theoretical issues in actual cases, and try to understand what their decisions have meant for the exercise of religious freedom. And we\xE2\x80\x99ll consider how the legal enforcement of morality has developed in Western society. The course will be conducted through lectures, discussion, and presentations by students.

How can one escape the endless cycle of misery, which is life-death-rebirth, in order to attain absolute Being, Knowledge, and Bliss? These are some of the philosophical issues that have occupied individuals and entire communities in India for over three thousand years. We shall look at the questions, and numerous competing answers, offered by a wide range of literary sources. Indian religious wisdom finds an eloquent voice in the poetry of the Rg Veda and the Bhagavadgita, as well as the speculative Upanishads and the brilliant commentaries by Shankara. We shall also look at the medieval theologies of devotional sects and Tantra, and the modern syntheses of Sri Aurobind, Vivekananda, and Radhakrishnan.

  - :name: Christian-Buddhist Dialogue
    :number: "170"
    :description: "Buddhism and Christianity: two distinct religions which many think go together like oil and water. Despite, or perhaps because of significant differences between these two faith traditions, people from each of them have found their personal faith transformed and strengthened by encountering and dialoging with members of the other faith tradition. How is this possible? What ways could Buddhists encounter Jesus, what ways can Christians encounter Siddhartha? What kinds of intra-religious dialogue is possible? How have Buddhists interacted with and engaged Christians within their own theological traditions? How have Christians engaged Buddhists within their own traditions? In this class, we will encounter several Buddhist and Christian thinkers including but not limited to Masao Abe, Thich Nhat Hanh, the Dalai Lama, John Keenan, Fr. Robert Kennedy S.J, and Raimon Panikkar, and listen to what they have to tell us about inter-religious dialogue and specifically Buddhist-Christian dialogue. We will look at several aspects of the dialogue, from ways Buddhists and Christians have shared their own spiritual experiences with each other, to the ways they have offered creative, insightful philosophical and theological critiques of each other\xE2\x80\x99s traditions. No previous knowledge of Buddhism will be required for the course."

    :description: "Challenging ambiguities exist in feminist thought between women\xE2\x80\x99s experiences, ethical concerns, and religious traditions. Can practices or situations detrimental to the well-being of women be identified and criticized across religious and cultural boundaries? Do such criticisms necessarily enshrine white Western Imperialist values? On what philosophical, ethical, and religious foundations do contemporary thinkers build cross-cultural proposals for social justice for women? On what grounds are such proposals challenged from within particular traditions? In this upper-level course in religious ethics, we will examine several important approaches to social justice generated by these concerns within feminist ethics (secular and theological), paying particular attention to the role of religion in these proposals. Our analyses will always be contextualized by careful consideration of case studies, personal narratives, and current events reflecting women\xE2\x80\x99s lived experiences."

    :description: Modern Western culture saw the emergence of a new approach to the study of religion, which is often called religious studies. This approach sought to bracket the confessional claims of particular religious traditions and develop a relatively neutral approach to understanding religion as a human phenomenon. This course will explore the significance of religious pluralism from the various perspectives of the discipline of religious studies. The course will review the history of the study of religion through the methods of religious studies. It will also review contemporary scholarship on religious pluralism in religious studies, including the work of Jonathan Z. Smith.

    :description: "This course is one of the three \"pluralism seminars\" of the doctoral program, the first with a theological focus, the second with an ethical focus, and the third with a cultural focus. This course is one with the theological focus. Its purpose is twofold. First, for students who have had no or little background in Christian theology, it serves as an intensive introduction to the methods and basic themes of Christian theology. For students who already have a master\xE2\x80\x99s degree in Christian theology, it provides an opportunity to do an in-depth study of an aspect of Rahnerian theology. In both cases, however, the objective is to produce a comparative theology between a theme of Christian/Rahnerian theology with that of another religious tradition. Throughout the course, therefore, students must explore the possibility of how a particular theme in Rahnerian theology may contradict, correct or enrich a theological theme in another religious tradition and vice versa."

It explores the rich tradition of \"God-talk\" by Christian theologians, mystics, and philosophers throughout the centuries. Emphasis will be on method (how to speak about that which transcends speech and thought); on the relationship between faith and reason (how revelation is understood and what role philosophy can play); on types of religious experience of God\xE2\x80\x94especially liturgical, mystical, and aesthetic experiences (how they inform our understanding of God); and on ethics (the implications particular understandings of God has for who we are to be and how we are to act). The course is designed primarily as a lecture course with both primary and secondary readings assigned and with ample time for discussion. We shall begin with Tertullian\xE2\x80\x99s question, \"What does Athens have to do with Jerusalem?\" and with the doctrine of the Trinity as formulated and interpreted in the fourth century. We shall then proceed chronologically through major thinkers and movements, focusing on significant paradigm shifts in imaging, speaking about, and experiencing the divine. Close attention will be paid to the details of the texts, understanding them in their historical, cultural contexts. Attention will also be paid to issue of pluralism within Christianity: many of the doctrines of God we shall be studying are very different from each other, so what makes each a specifically Christian doctrine God?"

    :description: The biblical patriarch Abraham, called 'God's friend' in the scriptures of the Jews, Christians and Muslims, is a paradigmatic figure in the prophetic narratives of the three faith communities. They severally trace their religous ancestry back to him through his sons Ishmael and Isaac. In the process Abraham emerges as an important interreligious icon. This course traces the developing discourse over the centuries within Judaism, Christianity and Islam about Abraham and his sons. It puts an emphasis on the emergence of the figure of Abraham in modern theologies as an interreligious prophet in reference to whom the monotheistic Jews, Christians and Muslims can find elements of a common faith identity, which many hope can facilitate their current dialogue with one another.

    :description: "The central theme considered in the course is this: how does Catholic faith (as a religion of \"both/and,\" not \"either/or\") interact with various forms of human culture. The class will investigate Catholic tradition to see how it emerged from earlier, existing cultures and how it developed its own forms of cultural expression. We will in addition probe its relevance for contemporary society. We begin with narrative: the earliest stories about Jesus of Nazareth, the problems in reading them, and the central beliefs of Catholicism as they are derived from these accounts. After this overview, we look at four ways in which Catholicism has found expression within human cultural traditions. 1. Catholicism and society. What role do Catholics play in government and social organization and how does Catholicism relate its faith to public policy? We will read the American Bishops' Letter on the Economy of the USA. 2. Personal narratives. What meaning have people found in Catholicism in their own personal lives? Here we will read the autobiographies of St. Augustine [4th C.] and Dorothy Day [20th C.]. 3. The fine arts. How has Catholicism shaped aesthetic imagination? We will study the poetry, architecture, painting, and sculpture of Michelangelo. 4. The physical world. What can Catholicism say about nature, science, and present environmental concerns? We will consider authors such as Teilhard de Chardin and John Haught. There will be four concise student projects during the semester, one becoming a somewhat larger final essay. NOTE: This course satisfies one semester of the College Theology requirement."

    :description: "Religious critiques of consumer culture that contrast the values of Christianity (or other religions) with the implicit values of consumerism are well known. These fault consumerism for encouraging people to seek fulfilment in the selfish acquisition of things rather than in relationships with God and others. While there is much in these criticisms that is true, they overlook a more fundamental problem: how religious practice is itself transformed in consumer culture. Theoretical accounts of the \"commodification of culture\" suggest that religious beliefs and values are themselves likely to be treated as disposable consumer goods that are enjoyed and displayed, but have little impact on the shape of our daily lives. This has been linked to the rise of \"spirituality\" as a form of religious practice centered on individual choice, that is always in danger of descending into narcissistic detachment. An opposing perspective argues that consumption is itself a socially and politically potent act. Thus, consumer culture provides the opportunity for a vast expansion of religious creativity and intentional commitment. Drawing upon a range of methods and disciplines (cultural studies, economics, religious studies, sociology, and theology), this course will attempt to balance pessimistic and optimistic perspectives in order to understand the crises and opportunities that consumer culture poses for religious belief and practice."

The study of these ancient cultures shows us how heavily our modern cultures and religions have borrowed from them. In a relatively small geographical area, these major cultures, namely, the Greek, the Egyptian and the Mesopotamian cultures, coexisted and competed, yet without losing their distinctive characteristics. The aim of this course is to examine the specific religious character of each of these cultures, to define their main concepts which were so different that they produced wholly different civilizations--and to find out how these concepts survive to this very day. The readings will include religious and cultural writings of each of the civilizations studied.

It looks at questions of both "church and state" and "religion and culture," attempting to relate juridical, structural and constitutional analysis to broader cultural, religious, and theological analysis. The course begins, in part one, with a historical overview of the role of religion in ancient Hebrew and Islamic cultures, and with the relationship between church and state in Western Christian civilization from the time of Augustine through the Renaissance. Part two studies the constitutional structure of the United States, with emphasis on current Supreme Court religion clause jurisprudence and political policy issues such as faith-based initiatives and school vouchers. The third segment of the course looks at religious and theological understandings of the role of religion in America. If part two represents how the state looks at religion, part three represents how the religion looks at the state.

The first part of the course will offer an introduction to the methodology and general concerns of medical ethics from a Christian view. In the second part, we turn to reflect on the legal and theoretical issues that the end of life represents for ethical reflection. Finally, we proceed to the focal issue of physician-assisted suicide and the related ethical concerns surrounding it, such as the role of the physician, the withholding of treatment in severe cases, the place of autonomy, the possible ways of determining death, the meaning of suffering for the Christian, and the ethical relevance of quality of life issues.

    :description: A God who demands human sacrifice. A God who approves the torture of an innocent man. What sense are we to make of the biblical stories of Abraham and Isaac in Genesis 22 and of Job in the book that bears his name? In addition to biblical scholars and theologians, writers and artists from Soren Kirkegaard to Marc Chagall to Bob Dylan have asked the same question and offered their responses. By engaging these responses (and others, including those of Carl Jung, Robert Frost, rabbinic authorities, and Thomas Aquinas), and by undertaking our own close reading of the texts themselves, we will examine the twin themes of sacrifice and suffering in both ancient and contemporary contexts. As a four-credit course, this class will require students to engage in regular small-group discussion outside the classroom. Using such tools as "Blackboard," we aim to stimulate ongoing conversation about these endlessly complex and troubling religious questions.

In this seminar the role of such intellectuals will be examined to provide a conceptual context for viewing the work of a number of prominent Islamic activist-intellectuals of the 1980s and 1990s. This will include analyses of Hasan al-Turabi (Sudan), Rashid al-Ghanushi (Tunisia), Anwar Ibrahim (Malaysia), Khurshid Ahmad and Miryan Jameelah (Pakistan), Hasan Hanafi (Egypt), Abd al-Karim Sorush (Iran), and Islamic activist-intellectuals (Turkey, Central Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa).

Is this true? Do Buddhism and science affirm each other, perhaps even enhance each others\xE2\x80\x99 insights? The objectives of this course are: 1. To investigate the most current state of the dialogue between Buddhism and science, which centers on the interface between Tibetan Buddhist philosophy of mind and the Western cognitive sciences (psychology, linguistics, computer science, neuroscience). 2. To discern the larger philosophical problems that drive cognitive scientists to use Buddhism as a way of improving and/or justifying their theories\xE2\x80\x94for example, the controversy over scientific materialism. 3. To envision the dialogue between Buddhism and science in a different way\xE2\x80\x94particularly by using Buddhist views of language to appreciate and resolve the initial conflict between Christianity and science."

    :description: This course will look at a number of ritual and mythical religious contexts through the prism of current psychological theory. The class will practice reducing religious phenomena (such as ecstatic and mystical experiences, possession, pilgrimages, biographies of saints, and so forth) to psychological explanation. The psychological approaches that will be utilized in this class include psychoanalysis (Freud, Lacan, Melanie Klein), Gestalt and perceptual psychology, developmental psychology, and even neuropsychological theory, among others. The course is not a survey but a focused exercise in reduction and its implications. Although it will cover a wide range of material, a limited number of themes and methods will prevail.

This course will survey the ways in which the category of "culture" has been constructed in the social sciences, and how this has impacted the study and definition of religion. Topics include the phenomena of cultural globalization and commodification, and the current interest in popular culture. The impact of cultural syncretism on religious identity will also be examined. Finally, we will examine the crisis in cultural anthropology which suggests that "culture" is an academic invention.

The sages of the early Christianity not only wrote new scriptures, but re-read and reinterpreted old ones -- and in so doing created a unique Biblical culture. Topics to be explored include: the compositional history of the Hebrew Bible, the relevance of early Greek translations for both Judaism and Christianity, the canonization of Hebrew Scripture in both early Judaism and Christianity, the Dead Sea Scrolls and early Rabbinic exegesis, the making of the Christian Bible, allegorical, typological and \"plain meaning,\" interpretation, the Patristic conception of the Jews and their Scriptures, and the endeavor of the Fathers to identify the organic connections between Old and New Testaments."

We will explore the broadly and critically defined \xE2\x80\x9Cgenealogies\xE2\x80\x9D of women\xE2\x80\x99s studies and investigate the key concepts, theoretical debates, ideologies, and historical significance of the discipline. Learning and borrowing from Sophocles to Mary Wollstonecraft to Virginia Woolf to Audre Lorde, we, in a self-reflexive manner, attempt to construct a theoretical framework that will be helpful, productive, and challenging to our intellectual and practical pursuit of a juster world in which both women and men can celebrate themselves and each other. In this endeavor, special emphases will be given to the issues of violence, militarism, human rights, sexuality and body, labor, domesticity, and social activism. The investigation of these issues will be put in the context of related, but distinct, intellectual interrogations of race, class, nationality, ethnicity, and sexual orientations in the disciplines of cultural studies, race theory, postcolonial studies, and gay/lesbian studies."

This course will investigate how our attitudes about male and female sports are reflected in our cultural beliefs; how men and women are trained to think about competition, winning, and performance; and if Title 9 has made any significant impact on equality of opportunity for female athletes. The course will also examine how the American media plays a role in constructing stereotypes about winners, losers, masculinity and femininity. Through readings, films, guest speakers, class discussion, and analysis of current sports issues, we will explore the politics of athletics and gender--at our own university, in the larger society, and cross-culturally.

    :number: "235"
    :description: "This course proposes an interdisciplinary exploration of what it means--historically, culturally, physically, and medically--to have a women's body. As such, it provides an introduction to the key issues affecting women's health in the United States. The course is organized as an integrated sequence of study that includes: multimedia examination of historical constructs of female physical beauty and health; analysis of theory on women's body image and the social, economic, and political influences on women's health; scientific/medical study of women's bodies (physiologically women are NOT small men); and current challenges facing women's health. This course will strive to keep students working between theory and practice, so that positive body image and good health do not remain separate from intellectual understanding. For example, so many women's studies students intellectually understand the \"problem\" of body image and the associated impact on lifestyle decisions, yet many still starve themselves or adopt dangerous habits (i.e., smoking). These behaviors often result in a complex of symptoms known as the female triad: disordered eating patterns, amenorrhea (lack of menstruation), and osteoporosis. Additionally, potential cardiovascular, endocrine, and gastrointestinal consequences can occur. Thus, this course will explore the ways that women have defined their bodies, how the representation of women's bodies permeates the culture, and the resultant affects on women's sense of self-esteem and associated patterns of risk-taking behavior. In addition to developing a sense of \"ownership\" regarding how we view and treat our bodies, we will explore ways that social, political, public policy, and economic issues impact women's medical care and health. Recent evidence has shown that many health conditions have been under-diagnosed in women and that this gender bias has affected the management and outcomes of these diseases. Additionally, the report of the Public Health Service Task Force on Women's Health indicated that women have been seriously under-represented in clinical research, which has led to a lack of clinical data regarding the treatment of diseases that affect women solely, predominantly, or differently. Although the course will concentrate on health in this country, we also will do some comparative readings and spend one class session about women and health in other countries--to highlight the universal issues impacting women's health."

In doing so, it considers a series of gender-related issues in three parts: 1) the historical use of the law to create and maintain key institutions of gender-based oppression in society; 2) the efforts of activists, lawyers, and legal scholars to use the law to gain equal access to/equal treatment by such institutions, to dismantle those institutions, and/or to create new institutions; and 3) the effectiveness of legal tools in counteracting and changing the original character of legal institutions designed to implement and perpetuate gender-based oppression. Using U.S., non-U.S., and international legal sources, the course examines such topics as marriage, gendered violence, employment, prostitution and trafficking, and reproductive rights and asks the ultimate question - whether the \xE2\x80\x9CMaster\xE2\x80\x99s Tools\xE2\x80\x9D (the law) can dismantle the \xE2\x80\x9CMaster\xE2\x80\x99s House\xE2\x80\x9D (a society built on gender-based oppression).

    :description: As students living in Washington D.C., you may be familiar with the city's range of non-profits and intergovernmental agencies focused on development. This course is an invitation to step back and think critically about what development means, and how gendered assumptions underpin development theory and practices. How do development policies sometimes preserve, and at other times, transform gender relations? How have women been studied and incorporated/co-opted into the field of development? We will engage with the political economic context of neoliberal globalization, theories of development, and transnational and postcolonial feminist critiques. This involves critically examining the founding binaries of the field, such as 'first world/third world', 'traditional/modern', 'productive/reproductive labor' and 'global/local.' Our readings include case studies of how women cope with, and resist, economic and social injustice. Topics addressed are (a) poverty alleviation strategies, micro credit and fair trade movements (b) population policies and reproductive rights (c) global assembly line work (d) tourism and the sex trade (e) AIDS and (f) the environment and sustainable development. By the end of the semester, we will have interrogated and compared gender relations in varied regions of the world, while pondering the question of how power works, in and through the field of development.

    :description: In 1993, Toni Morrison became the eighth woman, first African American, first African American woman, and first Black woman to win the Nobel Prize in Literature. In its citation, the Swedish Academy praised her as one "who, in novels characterized by visionary force and poetic import, gives life to an essential aspect of American reality." This course--The Fiction of Toni Morrison--seeks to examine that "essential aspect of American reality" in Morrison's seven novels. Her works have received great acclaim, both critical and popular, because they celebrate the intricacies and complexities of human existence, in general, and Black life, specifically. Writing novels that she describes as novels she wanted to read, Morrison has chronicled African American experience from its beginnings in slavery to post-integration. Thus she has added not only to the African American literary and cultural landscape but also to the American literary and cultural landscape.

    :description: "Anyone entering the thickets of argument relating to violence, gender, and human rights today has to contend with the range and variety of meanings that these concepts have accrued in current usage. While there is broad consensus that there does exist a contemporary crisis around global violence and the suspected gendered aspect of it, how the relationships between globalization and human rights violations, and between violence against women and redefinition of human rights, are to be interpreted, and what is to be done about it is matters of vigorous intellectual and political debate. This class aims to explore the gendered manifestations of violence in public and private spheres within the context of the more general relationship among globalization, development, and human/civil/citizen rights. We will pay attention to banal violence (that is, daily and \xE2\x80\x9Cbanal\xE2\x80\x9D violence in everyday life), spectacular violence at moments of crisis, and the type of violence that disrupts the boundary between the two. Special emphases will be given to the issues of racism, sexual exploitation, poverty, labor, health care, homophobia, militarism, and globalization. The readings will include _We Wish to Inform you That Tomorrow We will be Killed with Our Families: Stories from Rwanda_ by Philip Gourevitch, _A Problem from Hell_ by Samantha Powers, _Violence against Women_ by Stanley French et al., _Are Prisons Obsolete_ by Angela Davis, _The Sterilization of Carrie Buck_ by J.

Sexuality is a site of social control \xE2\x80\x94-for instance by states, religions, families, and the media-- but it is also mobilized by women, youths, gender nonconformists, and queers across the world in ways that resist social control. Our goal is to explore how sexuality and power inter-relate, and to make sense of sexual control as well as creative struggles for sexual expression. Debates over state regulation of sexuality, sexual identity, youth sexuality, pornography, sex work, sexual consumption and lifestyles, sexual violence, sexuality in public and political life, and the global sex trade are central to this course. We also explore how marginalized sexual groups produce political change and how sexual power and perception are affected by issues such as racism, culture and religion. Finally, we will examine how sexuality directly plays a role in political power and the limitations of sexual politics that are based on Western constructs of sexual identity.

The broad range of performances to be investigated include theatre, religious ritual, electoral politics, public protests, parades, riots, revivals, temperance efforts and other expressive social practices. Students will discover that examining events as performance provides insight into how we perform ourselves and our lives as well as introduces an element of critique to otherwise descriptive accounts of social phenomena.

Social movements that span across countries and regions are reconstituting civil society and its relationship with the state. Today, new civil society organizations, including INGOs, advocacy groups and Diaspora networks, represent a non-state, non-profit \xE2\x80\x98third sector\xE2\x80\x99. According to most analysts, this sector is challenging established structures of power and helping advance global democracy and citizen participation. However, critics argue that the \xE2\x80\x98global civil society\xE2\x80\x99 and the new social movements are unrepresentative and unaccountable and that they constitute new forms of global political-economic and cultural domination. We will explore this conceptual debate on the globalization-governance-civil society nexus in relation to selected human rights, social justice and environmental movements. We will consider new directions in participatory democracy and the search for a middle ground that transcends extreme pro-global and anti-global positions.

    :description: "This course is a freshman seminar on the history of women in modern Europe. It will begin with a two week focus on the emergence of women\xE2\x80\x99s and gender history in the second half of the 20th century, acquainting people with just the basic terminology, concepts and theories in the field. Thereafter, it will dig into the history, starting with the emergence of feminist ideas in 18th century Europe and ending with developments up to and immediately following the fall of Communism in Eastern Europe. The goal of the course is to give students a solid understanding of this important history, one that will serve them well into later adult life. Though the focus of the course will be on women, we will obviously need to address gender expectations for both men and women. Thus, we will follow the relational history of women and men in chronological order so as to gain a clear idea of this history. There will be a basic textbook for the course, Bonnie Smith\xE2\x80\x99s CHANGING LIVES: WOMEN IN EUROPEAN HISTORY SINCE 1700, along with parallel readings in primary and secondary sources. Parallel books for the course will include Mary Wollstonecraft\xE2\x80\x99s a VINDICATION OF THE RIGHTS OF WOMEN, John Stuart Mill\xE2\x80\x99s THE SUBJECTION OF WOMEN, George Sand\xE2\x80\x99s INDIANA, John Ruskin\xE2\x80\x99s SESAME AND LILIES, Virginia Woolf\xE2\x80\x99s A ROOM OF ONE\xE2\x80\x99S OWN, and Paula Bartley\xE2\x80\x99s EMMELINE PANKHURST, as well as a couple of similar works for the twentieth century. The remainder of the parallel readings will include fascinating articles or chapters in books. In building the reading list for the course, there has been a concerted effort to find good readings on women (and men) in a variety of different European countries so as to shed light on both the similarities and the differences across the face of Europe. Written work for the course will consist of three 3 to 4 page comparative papers and five one-page response papers. There are no written examinations in this course."

    :number: "385"
    :description: The history of the American West is more than just cowboys and Indians. In fact, the nineteenth- and twentieth-century American West was one of the most diverse places on the planet. In addition to hundreds of distinct and unique American Indian cultures, the West was also home to immigrants from all over the world, from China to Finland to Chile. It was also a place where notions of masculinity and femininity, and the relationships between men and women, were constantly in flux and turmoil. As diverse men and women laid railroads, dug for gold, logged forests, built farms and cities, and raised families, they clashed over what place they would occupy in this new world. This course examines how ideas about gender and race shaped the creation of the modern American West. Readings will include both primary and secondary sources. In addition to short papers, an independent research paper will be required.

Besides examining everyday social interaction (between friends, couples, parents and children, and so forth), we will look at a variety of activities, including service encounters, job interviews, interactions in corporate settings, social scientific interviews, classroom interaction, and legal contexts. Research on intercultural communication has tried to identify implicit expectations in conversational behavior which vary from group to group, and which create interactional tension when these groups interact. (The term \xE2\x80\x9Cintercultural\xE2\x80\x9D is used broadly here to refer to any group-relative difference, not only to difference in terms of race, ethnicity, or national origin.) Our goal during this semester is to examine this literature and to understand how problems involving intercultural communication play out in everyday life. No prerequisites. COURSE REQUIREMENTS AND GRADING POLICIES Regular Class Participation (20% of grade [10% in class, 10% in discussion sections]): For each class, one or two students will be assigned the role of discussion leader. You will be expected to lead the class for approximately 10 minutes on one assigned reading for that day (drawing on your personal experiences, an article in the news, an academic article, a movie, and so forth). All the other students will be required to participate in class activities, even when not presenting. You are expected to come to class prepared to discuss the readings assigned for that day. A participation grade will be given for each class. Attendance: Regular class attendance is mandatory. Roll will be taken each class. You are allowed a maximum of 2 unexcused absences during the semester, after which your final participation grade will be lowered. If you are absent, it is your responsibility to find out what has been covered in class. You are also expected to come to class on time. Repeated tardiness will be counted as an absence. Discussion sections are mandatory. During discussion sections, you will have the chance to improve your knowledge on the readings by discussing them further with your classmates and with your TA. You are required to actively participate in the activities that the TA will create for you, and you will have the chance to review the material covered in class. Discussion sections constitute 10% of your final participation grade. Reading summaries/responses (15% of grade): For each class, you will write a short summary and a short commentary of the readings assigned for that day (1 page maximum, double-spaced). You will be required to turn these in at the beginning of each class. At the end of the semester, the summary/response assignment with the lowest grade will be dropped; your grade for this component of the course will then be determined from the remaining set. Fieldnotes (10% of grade): For each Wednesday, you will be required to write fieldnotes on the topics of the weekly readings. The idea is to identify phenomena described in the readings and lectures in your own lives. (1 page maximum, double-spaced; details to be described in class). The final grade for your fieldnotes will be calculated by dropping the lowest grade at the end of the semester. Fieldwork Project with Two Status Reports (20% of grade): You are required to collect, transcribe, and analyze data related to the theme of this course. These data should be collected in the Georgetown campus area and with consent from your informants and from your instructor. This material should serve as the foundation for the final paper. You can pursue any topic of your interest as long as it is related to the assigned readings, and as long as your topic is approved by the instructor. Sample topics will be described in class. You will present your final fieldwork project to the class during the last few class meetings (15 minutes per presentation, maximum). For all presentations, I encourage you to be creative and to use any media you wish to use. Please let me know any AV requirements you might need for your class presentation well in advance. You may want to visit the following website for more information: http://www.library.georgetown.edu/dept/gelardin/ Twice during the semester (weeks 5 and 10; see schedule below), you will be required to provide a status report on your fieldwork project. This should be 2 pages in length (double-spaced). It can offer details about the fieldsite, the participants, preliminary analysis and findings, and so forth. Your grade for the fieldwork project will be calculated based on the final presentation of the project (15%) and on the 2 project reports (5%). Final Paper (10 pages; 35% of grade): Students are required to write a final paper of no less than 10 pages, doubled spaced, with 1 inch margins, and in a reasonably sized font (i.e., Times New Roman, 12 pt.). The final paper should first describe the findings from the fieldwork project, and then bring in relevant readings from the class to contextualize the findings. The papers are to be sent to me electronically (in MS Word format) or may be put in my departmental mailbox no later than December 12th, 2007 at noon. No late papers will be accepted. Grading You will receive a point-based grade on all written assignments. Your final grade will be calculated based on the 2006\xE2\x80\x932007 Undergraduate University Bulletin (http://www.georgetown.edu/undergrad/bulletin/regulations3.html): A+ = 4.33* B+ = 3.33 C+ = 2.33 D+ = 1.33 A = 4.00 B = 3.00 C = 2.00 D = 1.00 A- = 3.67 B- = 2.67 C- = 1.67 F = 0.00 *While you may receive an A+ on an individual assignment, you may not receive an A+ as a final grade. Any final numeric grade over 4.00 will be considered an A.

  - :name: "Other Women: Cultural Representations of Gender"
    :number: "217"
    :description: "We will investigate the relationships among cultural representations of women as the Other, the exclusion and disempowerment of women in public spheres (through measures such as electoral politics and political decision-making procedures, as well as hiring practices), and women\xE2\x80\x99s negotiations and interventions in both areas. Does representing women as the Other in cultural texts influence and define the extent of disempowerment or victimization of women during that particular historical moment? Also, how sturdy and stable is the category of \xE2\x80\x9Cwoman\xE2\x80\x9D in cultural production and analysis when it is always already fractured along class- and gender-axes? In order to answer these questions, we will interpret and learn from writings about and by \xE2\x80\x9Cother\xE2\x80\x9D women: poor women, lesbian women, minority women, third world women, and undocumented alien women, for example. Our approach to these questions will be a truly interdisciplinary one that brings together the disciplines of women\xE2\x80\x99s s tudies, cultural studies, postcolonial studies, race and class theories, economics, and political sciences. Readings will range from Sophocles to Rigoberta Menchu to Toni Morrison to Nawal El Saadawi to Julia Alvarez to Mahasweta Devi. By studying the ways otherized women have been creating distinct public spheres and voices of their own through various activities of culture, we ultimately explore the liberating and transformative potentials of culture. In this endeavor, special emphases will be given to the issues of violence, militarism, sexuality and body, work, family, and human rights."

    :number: "220"
    :description: The aim of this course is to provide understanding of the rise and restructuring of the welfare state in post-industrial democracies and the ways in which these have shaped the gender order. We will use general international comparisons, but also focus on special issues. The US minimalist welfare state regime will be compared to European Union member states from a general dimension with the aim of showing the ways in which motherhood and care are organized. Organizational structure, child care, early childhood education and care services, and employment patterns of various countries will be discussed with their corresponding views on the roles of women and men, with some mention of the roles of children.

    :number: "178"
    :description: "This course investigates how female performers of various kinds\xE2\x80\x94ballad singers, parlor poets, lecturers, pseudonymous autobiographers and playwrights\xE2\x80\x94shaped notions of womanhood, race, sexuality and \"American-ness\" in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in New England. These performers may be regarded as \xE2\x80\x9Ccritics\xE2\x80\x9D because they all, in disparate ways, passed judgments on American culture; furthermore, they did not, as twenty-first century scholars do, worry about genre distinctions. Instead, they moved from one creative realm to another with ease. We will study the varied and complicated strategies that these critics used to gain access to the public sphere and to redefine the seemingly private sphere. For example, to protect their status as respectable wives and mothers, many women voiced their concerns indirectly, composing ballads and poems rife with hidden meanings, instead of publishing non-fiction commentaries. Others published their work anonymously, or under a male or female pseudonym. Still others populated the stage with dramatic characters who were bolder than they themselves could be. We will analyze the implications of the women\xE2\x80\x99s various avenues toward publication as well as their actual songs, poems, lectures, plays, and autobiographical novels. Our readings will include works by black and white women critics: Lucy Terry Prince, Phillis Wheatley Peters, Susanna Haswell Rowson, Judith Sargent Murray, Maria W. Stewart, Mary Carr Clarke, Louisa Medina, and Charlotte Sanford Barnes, Anna Cora Mowatt, and Harriet E. Wilson. We will analyze these women\xE2\x80\x99s publications within the context of contemporaneous debates about race and nation in an effort to understand the relationship between the performativity of identity and access to civic debates and full human rights."

    :number: "179"
    :description: "This course enables students to explore archives in the Washington, D. C., area so that they can investigate how and why black and white women activists staged their resistance to slavery and racism in late eighteenth and nineteenth-century America. Students will have an opportunity to study the varied and complicated strategies that female anti-slavery writers and speakers used to gain access to the public sphere or to redefine the \xE2\x80\x9Cprivate\xE2\x80\x9D sphere so that they could perform their sense of an emancipated America. Many activists found it difficult to publish their critiques as non-fiction, so they fictionalized their stories, composing ballads and poems instead of essays. Other abolitionists published their work anonymously, or under a male or female pseudonym. We will analyze the implications of the women\xE2\x80\x99s various avenues toward publication as well as their actual anti-slavery poems, essays, plays, speeches, short stories, letters, and autobiographical novels. Our theoretical readings and archival adventures will help us illuminate how female anti-slavery advocates shaped and reshaped the intersecting performances of womanhood, \xE2\x80\x9Crace,\xE2\x80\x9D sexuality and American-ness. Our readings will include Phillis Wheatley, Judith Sargeant Murray, Susanna Haswell Rowson, Maria W. Stewart, Lydia Maria Child, Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and a host of lesser-known anti-slavery lecturers and essayists. We will analyze these women\xE2\x80\x99s publications within the context of contemporaneous debates about (in)visibility, identity, \xE2\x80\x9Crace,\xE2\x80\x9D and nation in an effort to understand the tangled performance of anti-slavery in the United States. During the first half of the term, you will have a chance to investigate archival materials contemporaneous with a particular anti-slavery advocate\xE2\x80\x99s writings; in the second half of the term, you will be able to study archival materials written by the women abolitionists themselves. Prerequisite: Students registering for this semester should have taken an upper-class elective in one of the following areas: Ethnic and Critical Race Studies, Studies in Gender & Sexuality, or Cultural & Performance Studies. (A Gateway on Eighteenth & Nineteenth Century Literatures & Cultures may be substituted, with the permission of the instructor.) Students in American Studies, Women\xE2\x80\x99s Studies, Justice and Peace Studies, and Performing Arts may be especially interested in the material of this course."

    :description: "This course will explore how sex and sexuality may be read across time. We will begin by examining contemporary theoretical and critical developments in the history of sexuality. These perspectives will inform our consideration of sexuality in and around selected literary texts from antebellum America. As we examine the relationship between literary works and their cultural contexts, we will put considerable pressure on how \xE2\x80\x9Cappropriate\xE2\x80\x9D cultural contexts are defined and developed by literary scholars. Since this is a four-credit elective, students will also complete a semester-long project centered on the construction of critical-historical archives; this project will involve primary research at the Library of Congress and elsewhere. Course readings will likely include: theoretical, historical, and critical essays by Michel Foucault, Michael Warner, John D\xE2\x80\x99Emilio, Lauren Berlant, David Halperin, Hortense Spillers, Bruce Burgett and others, and literary works by Washington Irving, Catherine Maria Sedgwick, Nathaniel Hawthorne, William Wells Brown, Julia Ward Howe, Walt Whitman, Herman Melville, Harriet E.

    :description: The world seems to be exploding with ethnic and religious conflicts promoting political extremism and endangering democracy. Yet, our understanding of and solutions to these conflicts are woefully inadequate. This course seeks to address this dilemma, at least partly, by examining alternative theoretical perspectives and selected regional case studies. Established conservative, liberal and radical perspectives as well as more recent political-economic, cultural studies, gender and ecological approaches will be explored. Their relevance will be considered in the context of in-depth case studies of ethno-religious conflicts in the U.S., South Asia and other regions. International dimensions of these conflicts as well as democratic social movements and policy initiatives that seek conflict resolution will also be examined. [Comparative Government]

It will consider the different ways historians have approached the writing of women's history and encourage students to think critically about historical arguments and the difference that gender makes in our interpretation of the past. A central theme of the course will be to understand how women's experiences have differed across lines of class, race, ethnicity, geographic location and sexuality. Issues to be covered include the ideology of separate spheres, women's activism in reform movements, the evolution of the struggle for political equality, slavery, the relationship between domestic and paid work, sexuality and reproduction, consumption, civil rights, and the modern feminist movement. Readings will be drawn from both primary and secondary sources and will reflect the diversity of perspectives that define American women's history.

    :description: "JUPS 260/WSTP Violence, Gender, and Human Rights\xE2\x80\x94Fall 2006 Anyone entering the thickets of argument relating to violence, gender, and human rights today has to contend with the range and variety of meanings that these concepts have accrued in current usage. While there is broad consensus that there does exist a contemporary crisis around global violence and the suspected gendered aspect of it, how the relationships between globalization and human rights violations, and between violence against women and redefinition of human rights, are to be interpreted, and what is to be done about it is matters of vigorous intellectual and political debate. This class aims to explore the gendered manifestations of violence in public and private spheres within the context of the more general relationship among globalization, development, and human/civil/citizen rights. We will pay attention to banal violence (that is, daily and \xE2\x80\x9Cbanal\xE2\x80\x9D violence in everyday life), spectacular violence at moments of crisis, and the type of violence that disrupts the boundary between the two. Special emphases will be given to the issues of racism, sexual exploitation, poverty, labor, health care, homophobia, militarism, and globalization. The readings will include _We Wish to Inform you That Tomorrow We will be Killed with Our Families: Stories from Rwanda_ by Philip Gourevitch, _A Problem from Hell_ by Samantha Powers, _Violence against Women_ by Stanley French et al., _Are Prisons Obsolete_ by Angela Davis, _The Sterilization of Carrie Buck_ by J.

    :description: Social Intelligence in Everyday Life reviews and assesses the scope and potential of applied sociology. We examine the usefulness, limits, and possibilities of drawing upon the discipline of sociology to challenge common sense understandings of self and society, as well as to modify day-to-day social routines and practices. Social intelligence is the degree of awareness individuals and groups have about the complexity and predictability of diverse social forms and processes. Sociological theories used in these analyses emphasize differences among social classes, inequalities in power relations, social institutions, social systems, and contrasting cultural styles and viewpoints. We give particular attention to the influence of increased diversity in the U.S. and the world. We also question the extent to which a learned social intelligence and collective action can ameliorate problematic social conditions and increase social justice.

It serves to provide a critical response to the absence/invisibility of African American women in both feminist and Black liberation theologies and to acknowledge their "coming to voice" as articulators of a holistic communication theology which challenges racism, sexism, and classism. The issue will enable students to explore and critically analyze, from a holistic perspective, contemporary issues in both the religious and secular worlds. Insights will be drawn from literature, social sciences, history and other areas. Some background knowledge of either feminist and/or Black liberation theologies is encouraged.

Can practices or situations detrimental to the well-being of women be identified and criticized across religious and cultural boundaries? Do such criticisms necessarily enshrine white Western Imperialist values? On what philosophical, ethical, and religious foundations do contemporary thinkers build cross-cultural proposals for social justice for women? On what grounds are such proposals challenged from within particular traditions? In this upper-level course in religious ethics, we will examine several important approaches to social justice generated by these concerns within feminist ethics (secular and theological), paying particular attention to the role of religion in these proposals. Our analyses will always be contextualized by careful consideration of case studies, personal narratives, and current events reflecting women\xE2\x80\x99s lived experiences."

    :number: "265"
    :description: Why, given the democratic ideals directing US political discourse, is American society riven with inequalities? How have inequalities been structured through history along the lines of race, gender, class and sexuality? How does investigating these structures produce challenges to classical liberal theory? In this seminar, students are encouraged to develop a view 'from outside' and 'from below' of the historical and political landscape of this country. We will read texts on US history from the perspectives of the dispossessed and dislocated--native Americans, enslaved African and bonded Irish and Asian laborers, and immigrants from Eastern and Southern Europe. This allows us to trace how notions of race, as well as whiteness, have shifted over time. We will examine how racism affected early feminism and women's identities, and compare the struggles for women's suffrage with the abolition of slavery. We study the origin of the civil rights movement, its legacy, and the conservative backlash of the 1980s and 90s. This sequence of 'history first' equips us to discuss current 'hot-button' political issues in the second part of the semester. We will dissect contemporary debates on multiculturalism, affirmative action, welfare, gay marriage, corporate crime, and the post 9/11 crackdown on immigration and dissent. This involves moving beyond a two-fold conservative/liberal framework, and exploring the ideas of critical race feminists and left scholars. Our questioning of current inequalities thus keeps sight of how systematic privileges have emerged, and evaluates a range of scholarly challenges. Spring.

    :number: "268"
    :description: "The gendered underpinnings of nationalism and religious revivalism have been fruitfully analyzed by feminist scholars in the past two decades. This course will ground students in what is specific about the South Asian region (specifically India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Afghanistan) on this topic. We will pursue the following questions: How have nationalist and religious movements in South Asia relied on notions of masculinity and femininity? How do gendered notions of the home and tradition explain the appeal of nationalist and religious rhetoric, in the contexts of anti-colonial mobilization, globalization, and post 9/11 realignments? How do current debates on feminine identity, sexuality and culture map on to those from the nineteenth century? How have women and men subverted roles prescribed in religious and nationalist discourses? Using a transnational feminist perspective, we will explore the multiple masculinities articulated in the colonial period, and how these linger in sub-regional identities today; we will explore the complicity of European feminists in maintaining imperial power relations, and how this history relates to global feminist activism; we will learn about women's participation in pre- and post-Independence social movements; and we will ponder the gendered dimensions of globalization and militarism in this region. For SFS students, this course will demonstrate why attention to gender is crucial to understanding the power of nationalism, religious revivalism and globalization. For Women's Studies students, this course will explore how debates on nationalism, religion and gender have taken a specific route in the South Asian context, and it will provide a valuable look at the complicity of certain British feminist movements in the enterprise of empire. This course will also serve as an introduction to the history and cultural politics of modern South Asia for students generally interested in the region."

    :description: This course explores the relationship between colonial laws and sexual/racial identities in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and Africa. It provides a grounded history of how family forms, gender identities, sexual relations and racial classifications shifted in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. We begin with an analysis of how Victorian social mores affected colonial laws, and how sexual relations between settlers and colonized subjects were managed. We then look at how census classifications of race affected political identities, how gender relations were scripted in nationalist movements, and how social Darwinism affected notions of motherhood. We will review the struggles of women's movements in colonies, and why white metropolitan feminists were sometimes complicit with imperialist agendas, eg; in early anti-trafficking campaigns. We finally dwell on the lessons of this history for contemporary transnational feminist movements. (Not offered 2004-05)

    :description: This four-credit course aims to better understand the variety of medieval sexualities from a comparative sampling of social institutions and writings. We will study depictions of sexualities and gender issues in various European literatures, classical and medieval biological and medical texts, religious thought and law, and the cultural variation present across the religions, regions and periods from c. 500-1500. Students might expect, for example, to learn more of Anglo-Saxon attitudes from penitentials, to think about the implications of Irish laws on divorce, to read courtly literature through the lens of contemporary medical knowledge, to weigh the impact of clashing cultural attitudes, or to consider the connections between prosecution of heresies and accusations of deviancy. You will be expected to work on smaller papers during the term, building up your understanding and learning to research sources in this field, culminating in a longer, final written project on a topic of your choice, developed in consultation with the professor.

    :description: Queer Pre-histories. The course will focus on representations of dissident sexuality in 19th century US literature. Reading both canonical and popular literature, we will analyze the escalating importance of sexuality in the American cultural and political imagination. We will evaluate overlapping discourses of eroticism, morality, and public health as they shape representations of sex and sexuality, and will also devote particular attention to the part played by the sexual body in evolving constructions of race and gender, in emergent class identities, and in nineteenth-century political conflicts. Part of our purpose will be to examine the way that representations of sexuality in these texts prefigure the division of sexuality into an opposition between 'homosexuality' and 'heterosexuality'; however, we will also address the forms taken by sexuality beyond this binary division.

    :number: "212"
    :description: "This course aims to develop languages for analyzing the role of class in U. S. women's lives, languages sensitive to the complex interrelations of race, sexuality, ethnicity, gender, region, and class. Because of the general cultural and political invisibility of poor and working class women in contemporary America, we will pay special attention to the experiences and voices of poor and working class women; at the same time, we will explore our own class positions and experiences, reminding ourselves that all of us--not just poor and working class women--have class identities. As part of our analysis, we will discuss the role of class in education (including higher education), and the ways in which schools can serve to produce and reproduce the social relations of class. While we will look back to key historical moments of the last century (especially the 1930s, a period of intense capitalist crisis and labor activism), our emphasis will be on the contemporary moment: the gendered and racialized class relations of the so-called \"new economy,\" and the necessity of situating U. S. class relations within a global context. In pursuing our analysis, we will consider the respective historical blindnesses of both labor and feminist activism: the traditional masculinism of the labor movement (continued within the New Left), as well as the often-insufficient attention to class differences in feminist theory and practice. Course materials will include cultural productions--literary texts, media productions, and popular music--by poor and working class women, as well as historical, sociological, and theoretical analyses of class in the U. S."

    :number: "261"
    :description: "In this class we'll examine the writing lives of selected 20th century women poets who played significant roles in shaping the literary fields in which they worked, especially poets who doubled as editors, critics, publishers, and scene-makers. We will read closely the careers of four major figures--Marianne Moore, Gwendolyn Brooks, Margaret Walker, and Adrienne Rich. We'll also broaden our sense of both literature and literary history by studying women's networks--from the salons of Paris' Left Bank in the early part of the century, to Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez' negotiations of race and sex in the 1960s, to contemporary women poets across a range of identities and aesthetics. We will have rich connections to explore during the two periods in which women wielded the most power within the poetic field: Modernism (1910-30), and the re-emergence of women's poetic communities as second wave feminism made its mark in the 70s and 80s."

Politics, music, literature, philosophy, theater, art, poetry and the aesthetics will be our guide. The study of African American culture and its interaction with American and world society as a whole will be the mission of this class. We will look at the syncopated rhythms of the African people transferred to American shores by enslaved Africans, starting with the \xE2\x80\x9CNegro Spirituals. Political debates between W.E.B. DuBois and Booker T. Washington, between DuBois and Marcus Garvey and between Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Brother Malcolm X will also be demonstrated how history and politics affected the culture of Black people. We will look at white America\xE2\x80\x99s perception of African Americans and analyze how these ideas were formed and why they continue to exist and why they persist. We will look at the major intellectual, cultural, and performance arts during the Harlem Renaissance (performers such as Paul Robeson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, Marian Anderson, and Bessie Smith). We will watch films and film clips of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, Charles Mingus, John Coltrane, Ornette Coleman, Miles Davis and Thelonius Monk. We will also listen to the music of people who have been influenced by major Black artists. The role of artists and painters like Romare Bearden and Jacob Lawrence, and stage and theater performers like Lena Horne will also be reviewed. The roles and images of Blacks in films will be analyzed. We will also review poetry, literature, and the sports. Finally, we will take a look at the social and political meanings of Black culture, from the Negro Spirituals to Marvin Gaye, from Nina Simone to Tupac Shakur, from Jack Johnson to Muhammad Ali, from Dick Gregory to Chris Rock, and from Motown to Mos Def."

Many scholars of Africa have argued that the concepts of gender and generation are key to understanding Africa's political, legal and economic history. Using case studies from around the continent, we will consider how ideologies of gender and generation have been created in Africa and how they have been challenged or perpetuated in the colonial and post-colonial periods. We will examine the distribution of economic resources and political power, as well as institutions such as legal systems, religion, marriage, kinship and inheritance. Spring.

    :description: This course begins with a look at crucial methodology and theory, but then proceeds to survey basic developments in Europe since the late 18th century--in terms of both the consequences they had for women and the views men and women expressed with regard to those consequences. One often finds clear evidence of a "battle of the sexes," although the conflict is sometimes relatively low-keyed (as in women's struggle for equal access to education), or alternately strident (as in the quest for women's suffrage in England). Readings will include a richly diverse mix of primary and secondary sources.

    :description: The course approaches the topic of Islamic law, women, and gender as a study of a multilayered history. It is part the history of doctrinal development, the ways in which Islamic jurists, working with received texts and sophisticated methodologies, formulated rules about women, men, and their relationships. It is part the history of legal institutions and practices, how these rules were understood, implemented, and even modified by a range of legal actors, from individual judges to centralized state powers. It is also part the history of lay members of Muslim communities whose choices of doctrines to follow and legal avenues to pursue allowed the law to develop in rhythm with social needs, just as their legal inquiries and court appearances also served, at times, as contestation of legal discourse on women and gender issues. We look at the historical evolution of basic legal doctrines, the range of legal practices in the Ottoman and modern (19th and 20th centuries) periods, and end with an examination some of the heated legal issue of today.

    :description: This course explores the junctures of globalized labor, national "development," and the "postcolonial" world system by exploring the concepts of labor, sexuality, and bodies. When and how do we become "workers"? How do we imagine and represent sexualities and bodies in the contexts of national developments and policy making procedures? How do third world workers negotiate their agency from the positionality of the "subaltern"? We will read and discuss literary and cultural texts, fact-finding documents, and theoretical investigations so that the more rigorously historicized concepts of labor, sexuality, and globalization enhance our understanding of social justice, equality, and violence prevention. This is a student-centered, process-oriented seminar in which students work individually and in groups to prepare written and oral reports and critiques. Each student is asked to make two oral presentations and to write a short essay (3-5 pages) and a longer term paper (8-10 pages).

    :number: "518"
    :description: "Phil. 518-01: GENDER AND EQUALITY Alisa Carse F 10:45-1:15, NN 204 Course Description Many of us agree that few facts about us are as powerful and significant for questions of identity, self-understanding, and life prospects as our gender. Yet what sort of \"fact\" is the fact of one's gender? What differences mark women and men as female and male, and how fixed and universal are these differences? Are gender differences natural, social, or cultural in their origin? Are they all three? How does the significance of gender intersect with other facts about us, such as our sexual orientation, ethnicity, religious heritage, level of education, or socioeconomic status? On these questions, we find deep and significant disagreement and debate. In this course we will bring a philosophic lens to difficult questions about gender and its significance for social and political equality. We will examine a variety of (sometimes conflicting) interpretations and explanations of gender difference, as well as a range of theories analyzing gender subordination. Among the topics we will address are the following: images and norms of masculinity and femininity; conceptions of \xE2\x80\x9Cequality,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Coppression,\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x9Csubordination,\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cprivilege;\xE2\x80\x9D the problem of androcentrism; gender and the politics of appearance; gender and shame; gender and sexuality; sexuality and violence; conceptions of \xE2\x80\x9Cliberation.\xE2\x80\x9D Close attention will be given to differences within \xE2\x80\x9Cfeminist\xE2\x80\x9D thought and other theoretical orientations as they bear on these and other issues.

  - :name: "Research Seminar: Family Patterns"
    :number: "299"
    :description: "Scope of Course All students must have completed Introduction to Sociology before enrolling in Advanced Research Seminar: Family Patterns. This intellectual foundation is an invaluable source of some of the basic sociological concepts, theories, and research methods which will be used in Family Patterns. The focus of the Family Patterns seminar, \"family patterns,\" derives from William J. Goode's classic monograph, World Revolution and Family Patterns, 1963. In this work Goode's family patterns describe and explain a wide range of intergenerational family processes and related social changes throughout history and among contrasting cultures. This kind of broad approach is taken in Advanced Research Seminar: Family Patterns in order to include a wide variety of theories and research methodologies which have deepened our understanding of diversity in families, as well as the different interests of students who will undertake substantial family research projects throughout the semester. Advanced Research Seminar: Family Patterns is built on two existing Department courses: Family Interaction, a micro-sociological study of intergenerational family interaction (Hall teaches two sections of this course every two years, with a maximum enrollment of 25+25 students); and Family and Society, a macro-sociological, institutional analysis of family changes (which Hall taught last in Fall 1999, with a maximum enrollment of 45 students). The Advanced Research Seminar: Family Patterns integrates micro- and macro-studies of individual and social behavior within three generation families and between families and family institutions. Particular attention is given to the wide range of family forms and family negotiations created by the major social influences of gender, race, ethnicity, culture, social class, the global economy, politics, religions, education, and history. This advanced research seminar deepens our intellectual and sociological understanding of diverse families, as well as heightens our awareness of some of the social justice issues related to the optimal conditions and considerations of family well-being. The discipline of sociology is presented as a useful means to understand families, as well as a way to conceptualize family problem-solving ventures in individual, family, community, and societal settings. Sociological research findings about families suggest directions for social policies and social movements, and inform the design of national and international social interventions. Because of these study objectives, Family Patterns creates opportunities for sociology majors and other interested students to consider family studies and family concerns as professional career choices."

Our analysis of each mystic will be threefold: (1) we shall begin with her historical, cultural, and political context; (2) we shall undertake a close reading of the theological content of her writings and examine her methodology; and (3) we shall undertake a comparative study in which we consider such issues as religious authority, 'holy anorexia', and the role of physicality and the senses in mysticism."

Was love\xE2\x80\x94eros or amor\xE2\x80\x94indistinguishable from sex, just a physical function, or could you think in higher terms about that old black magic that pulls two beings together? How\xE2\x80\x94on what terms or in what sense\xE2\x80\x94could love result in tragedy? What was the etiquette of desire: could you pursue just anybody or were there rules to the game? When the ancients looked at the human body, what struck them as desirable? For that matter, what struck them as masculine or feminine behavior? This course explores such questions through a series of readings including personal lyric, Greek tragedy and Roman comedy, literary representations of bourgeois romance, and philosophic texts by Plato and Augustine. In class discussions we re-construct the ancient Greek and Roman cultures of love, desire, and sexuality, and compare our own culture\xE2\x80\x99s constructions."

Whatever is profound and provocative\xE2\x80\x94and indeed, original\xE2\x80\x94in Shakespeare, Schiller, O\xE2\x80\x99Neill, or Wilson must be set against the foundation of tragedy: the Oresteia of Aeschylus; the Oedipus Tyrannus and Antigone of Sophocles; or the Medea and the Bacchae of Euripides.

    :description: What is archaeology? In this course, we will attempt to answer this question by examining both the history of archaeology as it has developed since the Renaissance in Europe and the methods used by present-day archaeologists who study the civilizations of the ancient Mediterranean. In the course of our study of the history of archaeology, we will read first-hand accounts of the most important discoveries of the past 400 years, including Pompeii and Herculaneum, Knossos, Troy, and King Tut's tomb. Our consideration of methods will include readings about excavation, field survey, scientific techniques such as faunal analysis and remote sensing, archaeological ethics, and the trade in antiquities. At the end of the course, students will present the results of their own research on individual topics. (This course fulfills the senior seminar requirement.) Additional courses in the classical humanities are offered in the departments of Art, Music & Theater, Government, and Philosophy.

It is taught in English and all readings are in English; it assumes no knowledge of French. The course combines the pleasure of reading imaginative literature with the need to move beyond the pleasure principle and take a more distanced perspective. Its focus is thematic and interpretive. The readings are selected from French, German, and English literature (20th-12th centuries); there is also a film. These texts are all linked thematically in that they are stories about growing up and finding one's identity. Growing up is a complex, mysterious, and sometimes arduous process that the hero/heroine experiences as a magical world where the natural laws governing human existence are suspended, the unexpected is bound to occur, and marvels are reserved for the chosen few. The choices to be made, dangers to be faced, and discoveries to be made, all help the hero/heroine relate to his/her own world and the conventional, mundane public world outside. Friendship, family, love, good and evil, authority and power, success and failure, responsibility, belief and knowledge and inexplicable mystery--these are essential experiences that structure and develop identity, in real life and in literature, today as well as yesterday. These readings are fantastic in both senses of the word: they create for their hero/heroine a magical world that is outside us readers and yet inside us too, and they are fabulous reading. This course does not count toward the French major or minor."

We will go on to examine other portrayals of Latin American society that highlight themes of continuing relevance: poverty, discrimination, violence, sexual inequality, and AIDs. Ren\xC3\xA9 Marqu\xC3\xA9s brings to the stage the plight of rural Puerto Ricans who migrate to seek a better life. Other plays reflect the social turmoil of mid-century, for example, Jos\xC3\xA9 Triana\xE2\x80\x99s dramatic fantasy on repression and rebellion and Egon Wolff\xE2\x80\x99s depiction of the complacency of Chile\xE2\x80\x99s upper middle class and its inevitable consequences.

Several plays deal with sexuality, homosexuality and changing roles of women (Puig, Chocr\xC3\xB3n, Bortnik, Ott, Berman). Jorge Di\xC3\xA1z\xE2\x80\x99s Cepillo de dientes explores problems of incommunication in societies dominated by technology.

This course discusses questions raised by the World Health Organization's World Health Report 1998: Will the world continue to grow healthier in the 21st century, with more disease conquered by scientific advances and life expectancy extending ever longer, or will new diseases, failing drugs, poverty, and socioeconomic gaps cancel out these gains? How does the health situation of the U.S. compare with other countries? How can the health situation of the population in developed and underdeveloped countries be improved? Looking at major determinants of health and disease in different national contexts, the student will analyze the main transnational factors that influence the transfer of risks to health and the structural conditions that determines one country's vulnerability in a globalized economy."

    :description: "ECONOMIC STABILIZATION AND REFORM IN LATIN AMERICA (LASP-453, Monday 5:15-6:55 pm. Fall 2006) Luis I. J\xC3\xA1come H. (Office hours: Monday 6:55-7:55 pm) This seminar discusses the fundamentals of the recent economic stabilization and reform in Latin America and the main challenges ahead. The proposed analysis focuses on the experience since the early 1990s, when the vast majority of countries in the region endorsed an agenda of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to cope with sky-rocketing inflation and boost economic growth after a decade of income per-capita contraction. Nonetheless, the results of these policies were not as positive as scholars and policy makers envisaged initially. Many countries in the region suffered systemic financial crises that harmed economic growth, while living conditions of most Latin American citizens benefited only marginally throughout the 1990s. Although short-term economic prospects look promising today, important challenges lie ahead. Thus, this seminar will address not only the main lessons from the recent macroeconomic management in Latin America, but will also ascertain possible avenues to avoid previous shortcomings and contribute to secure a path of sustainable prosperity in the region. The seminar will combine class sessions, students\xE2\x80\x99 in-class presentations, and special lectures. To this effect, it will demand research and participation from students and will benefit from lectures conducted by invited speakers who have a record of experience on the areas if study in Latin America. The seminar requires much reading and students are expected to read materials in advance to each class. While no prerequisites are demanded to perform successfully in this seminar, students are expected to handle fluently key macroeconomic concepts. I intend to go over them during our first ssession. Required text: IMF, Occasional Paper No. 238, Stabilization and Reform in Latin America: A Macroeconomic Perspective on the Experience Since the Early 1990s, (Washington: International Monetary Fund, 2005). Evaluation: Grades will be given according to the following three criteria: Class participation 25%: in-class presentation of selected topics. Midterm exam 25%: in-class examination. Final exam 50%: take-home examination. Topics to be discussed during the course: 1. Basic macroeconomic concepts 2. Main macroeconomic developments in LATAM during the 1990s, and where do we stand? 3. Trade liberalization, good or bad? 4. Fiscal policy and sustainability 5. The reform of monetary policy: progress and challenges 6. Revisiting exchange rate policy 7. Financial dollarization. 8. The quest for financial stability 9.

  - :name: Politics of Race and Ethnicity
    :number: "487"
    :description: "Latin America is a region of great racial, ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity. According to recent demographic surveys, there are over 40 million indigenous people and 120 million Afro-descendant people in Latin America, comprising over 40 percent of the region\xE2\x80\x99s population. In several countries, such as Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, Mexico and Peru, indigenous peoples comprise a majority of the country\xE2\x80\x99s rural population. While in other countries, such as Brazil, Colombia, Cuba, the Dominican Republic, and Venezuela, Afro-descendant people form a major part of both the rural and urban workforce. Despite this continuing presence of indigenous and Afro-descendant people, only recently have national constitutions begun to recognize the rights of these populations to maintain their ethnic and cultural identities, to be protected against racism and other forms of discrimination, and to be provided with equal access to land and to educational, employment and other opportunities. One of the major reasons for this recent recognition of the rights of indigenous and Afro-descendant peoples is the emergence of several new social movements whose main purpose has been to affirm the political, civil, and social rights of these peoples and to call for a more formal recognition of the multi-ethnic, multi-cultural and multi-lingual nature of Latin American societies. There have also been several recent conferences, sponsored by the United Nations, the Organization of American States and other international agencies, which have led to a series of new international conventions and agreements calling for the combating of racial and ethnic discrimination and the recognition of cultural diversity. In a sense, for the first time in their histories, many Latin American countries are today faced by the challenge of creating truly multi-ethnic, multi-racial and multi-cultural democracies. A major purpose of this course will be to provide students with a systematic overview of the contemporary history of race and ethnic relations in Latin American countries; the political and social role which the new indigenous and Afro-descendant movements are playing in changing the images of these countries; and, the challenges which Latin American countries face in creating more equitable and inclusive democracies. The course itself will be open to both advanced under-graduates and graduate students and be conducted in a seminar format It will demand a relatively large amount of weekly readings, active class participation and the preparation of a mid-term essay assignment of 8 to 10 double-spaced pages in length and a final paper of 15 to 20 pages in length on racial and ethnic relations and government policies and programs in a specific Latin American or Caribbean country. In the first part of the course, we shall be reading three recent books on the general situation of indigenous peoples and Afro-descendant populations in Latin America. We shall then turn to more detailed discussions of Afro-descendant and indigenous movements and resulting government policies and programs in such countries as Brazil, Colombia, Bolivia, Ecuador, Peru, Guatemala and Mexico. We shall also consider how various international agreements such as the ILO Convention 169 on Indigenous Peoples of 1989; the UN Conference Against Racism and Discrimination held in Durban, South Africa in September 2001; and, the Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity approved at the 31st Session of the General Conference of UNESCO in Paris in November 2001 have affected the social policies and programs of Latin American countries in relation to the human and cultural rights of indigenous peoples and Afro-descendent populations. The course itself is currently scheduled to be held in ICC 116 on Monday evenings between 7 and 9 pm. Note: A more detailed Course Description and Class Schedule and Reading List for LASP 487-01 as given in the Fall 2005 semester is posted on the EXPLORE website for the course and will be minimally revised prior to the beginning of the course in September 2006. B.

  - :name: Comparative Democratization
    :number: "525"
    :description: The study of democracy and democratization has a long history in the social sciences. Interest in this topic has expanded dramatically in recent years, because of the spread of the so-called "third wave" of democratization extending from Southern Europe and Latin America to Eastern Europe, Africa and parts of Asia. Thus, to the considerable literature on democratization as a historical process of social change has been added a number of new studies of what could be termed "quick democratization." It is primarily this latter research, and its intersection with historical work, that we will be addressing in this course. The course is guided by three goals. First, to introduce students to the major issues, theories, concepts and arguments in the literature on democratization. Second, to give students a comparative perspective on some of the major cases of recent transitions from authoritarian rule. Third, to engage the current literature on the "quality of democracy," and assess the performance of democracy in a comparative way, that is, looking at new and old democracies together.

    :description: "The course will explore conceptual-theoretical and practical, policy-oriented issues concerning crime, corruption and democratic governance. Our central organizing questions are: What are the nature of and relationships between common crime and organized crime? Between these and broader problems of private and official corruption? In what respects and to what degree does crime threaten the creation or maintenance of democratic institutions and forms of governance? What measures can be taken by governments and/or actors in civil society to cope with such threats? What kinds of responses can be mounted to confront the transnational character of criminal activities? We shall start our inquiry along thematic lines, beginning with conceptual and theoretical issues and moving on to consider different types of organized crime (e.g. , drug, trafficking, illegal migration) and forms of corruption. Then we shall look at three different types of settings to explore the crime-politics nexus: (1) industrialized democracies; (2) Post-Communist societies; and (3) developing countries.

    :description: "This number will be used for colloquia devoted to specific subjects in the area of Latin American history. Students may take more than one of the courses offered under this number. Each course will be announced in the course schedule and receive its own sub-title. In Fall 2006 the following course is offered: Mexico: Agrarian revolution to modern nation. Students of this course will discuss and understand the most important historical processes that shaped the transition from a predominantly agrarian society to an urban-industrial one in 20th-century Mexico. They will also analyze how this transition occurred in the context of changing relations between the national state and the most important social and economic actors, giving the foundation for different models of important development: an enclave economy during the Porfiiato, agrarianism in the aftermath of the Mexican revolution, Import Substitution Industrialization after the 1930s, and economic liberalization from the 1980s onward. Above all, this course aims at providing students with analytical tools to engage the complexity of historical developments and transitions that have characterized modern Mexico. Themes will include Mexico's insertion into international trade, agrarianism, cultural transformations, rural-urban immigration, educational modernization, the consolidation of the middle class, Mexico's relationship with the United States, and economic liberalization. Students will be evaluated through three papers and class participation. In Spring 2007 the following course is offered: The Amazon: Between Eden and Wasteland. This course will examine the dynamics between man and the environment in the Amazon from pre-historic times to the present, with an emphasis on Brazil. The class is designed to attract students from many disciplines by exploring the Amazon from historical, literary, environmental and anthropological perspectives. Selected readings and films will examine cultural constructions of Amazonians, e.g., noble savages, cannibal Indians, extravagant rubber barons, destructive settlers. The class will examine the Amazon as a frontier society, where the presence of the State is weak, and the interests of Indians, settlers, environmentalists, miners and developers collide and lead to conflict. The class will study four periods: Part I: controversies over the population size, complexity, and human transformations of Amazonian society before European conquest. Part II: the devastating impact of conquest and colonization on indigenous societies from the 16th century to the mid-19th century. Part III: the Amazon rubber boom (1850-1912), which transformed the Amazon into a producer for the world economy, stimulated migrations, and created cities in the rainforest. Part IV: 20th century State-led efforts to develop and colonize the Amazon and the resistance organized by indigenous groups, environmentalists, rubber tappers and international supporters to contest predatory development."

Violation of basic human and environmental rights, racial and gender discrimination, and acute economic disparities, are only a few of the challenges against which Latin American citizens have mobilized. Even with the transition to democracy in recent decades, Latin American citizens have enjoyed unequal access to the rights of citizenship. This course will examine recent Latin American dictatorships and democracies and assess the effectiveness of various groups to express. The central question we will ask is: what does citizenship mean for groups that have not fully benefited from the promises of democracy? What are their demands? What strategies have grass-roots groups used to achieve their goals? What constrains have they faced? What less ons can be drawn from each case? Can these lessons be applied to other contexts? Although there are no specific prerequisites for this course, it is recommended that students have some previous knowledge of recent Latin American history."

These revolutions in information and technology are also increasing trade integration and other interdependences across countries and regions. The course starts with a brief overview of the role of technology in growth and development, as well as the basics of invention, innovation, and commercialization of technology. It explores the interplay between four critical elements of a country's readiness to take advantage of these revolutions: a demanding economic incentive and institutional regime; an educated and skilled population; a dynamic information infrastructure; and an effective innovation system. It uses measures of these elements to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the US, the main European countries, Japan, China, India, Russia, Brazil, Mexico, and major developing regions. It also explores how the technology and information revolutions affect four key issues of global concern: inequality, security, sustainability, and quality of life. With these building blocks and some basic assumptions about key political and economic trends, students will be asked to project how the world may look in 2020, and to propose actions to improve these prospective futures.

In particular, we look at specific economic, legal and political factors that form the basis for institutional differences between developing and developed nations and play a critical role in shaping the business environment in these economies. This course is designed with two broad objectives: 1. To understand how institutional differences between developing countries and developed countries affect industrial development and government policy towards business. 2. To learn empirical tools with which to analyze such differences.

At the same time recovery and reform from the financial crisis of 1997 have forced radical change in the developing economies towards uniform IMF standards. This course tracks those changes in East Asia and Latin America to provide a window on contested visions of development. Problems of growth versus equity, democracy versus repression, tradition versus modernity takes us to the core experience of bridging the local with the global. A review of political economy, culture, and the lived experience of development alerts us to both the intellectual and human dimensions of this critical human project. Questions of modernity and postmodernity in society and culture, at home and abroad, in Latin America and Asia give direction to the study.

    :number: "499"
    :description: The role of consciousness and awareness in the human attentional system while learning has been particularly controversial in the fields of cognitive psychology, cognitive science, and second language acquisition. More specifically, there is considerable controversy regarding the role of awareness at the level of noticing (Schmidt, 2001; Robinson, 1995) or detection (Tomlin & Villa, 1994) in L2 learning. This controversy is further compounded by two methodological problems in addressing the role of awareness in language learning, namely, defining precisely what constitutes awareness and operationalizing or measuring awareness. In this seminar we will review these issues of awareness in learning in both non-SLA and SLA fields and conduct a data-based research project that will address the role of awareness in SLA.

    :description: "This course, required for the program, is an interdisciplinary introduction to medieval culture. It focuses on a pivotal 50 year period in the high Middle Ages, 1275-1325, roughly the period of Dante's life, but also a period of major developments in the history of the papacy, the Holy Roman Empire, the development of the city, vernacular literature, medieval art and architecture, the universities, optics, astronomy, music, banking and trade, European-Islamic cultural relations, and much more. The central text will be Dante's Divine Comedy, but our approach will be interdisciplinary and we will also read works by Augustine, Boethius, Virgil, Italian poets (Guinizelli, Cavalcante) and historians (Dino Compagni) contemporary with Dante. We will study the Lorenzetti frescoes painted in the Palazzo Publico in Siena and some works of Giotto. We will also read several other works of Dante: the Vita Nuova on love; the De Monarchia for political theory; and the De Vulgari Eloquentia for Dante's theory of language.

    :number: "701"
    :description: "In his novel The Name of the Rose, Umberto Eco models his hero, William of Baskerville, after William of Ockham, for he is a figure in the history of philosophy who moved the focus of knowing from that on abstract essences to the empirical individual available to our senses. What better figure for a detective who begins with singular, contingent facts in solving a series of murders in a monastery. But the reality behind the legend has only recently come to light, since we now have all the philosophical works of Ockham finally available in good critical editions with reliable texts. We are in a better position than ever before to assess his contributions to the change in thinking about (i) what types of things exist and (ii) what knowledge is, what its object is and its limits. In this course, then, we will investigate William of Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s contributions to metaphysics and epistemology. In metaphysics, we will examine the problem of the ontological status of universals. And as an introduction to this question, we will read two essays by Michael Loux on the contemporary debate over universals, one on metaphysical realism (as defended for example by B. Russell, R. Chisholm and D. Armstrong) and the second on nominalism (as defended for example by W.V. Quine, H.H. Price and D.C. Williams). With a clear view of the problem and of the main solutions/options, we will be in a position to understand Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s attempted reductionist ontological program and his view that \xE2\x80\x9Cuniversals are not things other than names\xE2\x80\x9D. In the second part of the course, we will look at Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s epistemology, both his conceptual empiricism and direct realism, along with Ockham\xE2\x80\x99s views on certainty and scepticism. The main text will be William Ockham (Notre Dame University Press, 1987, two volumes) by Marilyn McCord Adams, a landmark book, the first and best full-length study of Ockham based on the critical edition. But we will begin the course with Michael J. Loux\xE2\x80\x99s Metaphysics: A Contemporary Introduction, second edition, 2002, chapters one and two dealing with universals. Translations of Ockham on universals are to be found in Five Texts on the Medieval Problem of Universals, (Hackett, 1994) translated and edited by Paul Vincent Spade. You can buy all the texts on the web. Any other translated texts will be photocopied. The writings of William of Ockham are remarkably clear and challenging, like the best of analytic philosophy today. Once a number of technical terms are explained, students will be able to see how Ockham must confront the same or similar problems that face anyone who adopts one of various contemporary forms of nominalism."

    :description: "The seminar will be an intensive introduction to the art of Albrecht D\xC3\xBCrer (1471-1528) and to some of the staggering range of interpretive effort it has attracted. D\xC3\xBCrer's work as a painter, printmaker, publisher, and theorist established him as one of the most influential artists of the western tradition. His impact was immediate and widespread, and has taken many shapes since the sixteenth century. One of the appeals of D\xC3\xBCrer for modern observers is the breadth and depth of his engagement with any number of historical and intellectual spheres. We will, for example, consider his work with regard to religion (changing devotional currents, the fledgling Reformation, etc.); local culture (German identity, gender relations, witchcraft, humanism, etc.); international travel and 'publicity' (mainly in Italy and the Netherlands); radical reformulation of the very idea of the artist as a unique individual (via self portraiture and the distribution of monogrammed prints, etc.); and other dimensions. The seminar does not require students' previous study of D\xC3\xBCrer, but some coursework in Renaissance and later art history, or in related fields, will be a significant help."

    :description: "In this course we will explore various modes of performance in late medieval England in light of both medieval and contemporary theories of performance, ritual, and theater. Drama itself will be a significant focus; in particular, we will seek to gain an in-depth understanding of the great Corpus Christi cycles, examining their origins, the theories of \xE2\x80\x9Cplay\xE2\x80\x9D that motivate them, their robust humor and its relation to their theological aims, their function in both supporting and contesting ideals of civic unity, the ways they seek to construct and channel emotional response, and their tendency to collapse distinctions between spectator and spectacle, elite and popular, sacred and profane. But an equally important aim of the course is to investigate the performative aspects of late-medieval English culture more generally. Thus we will consider topics such as the oral performance of lyrics, romances, and sermons; the performativity of legal language and the language of Christian ritual; participatory affective piety, including the use of holy dolls, meditative writings, and devotional objects; civic processions and public executions; dance, gesture, and body language in both sacred and secular contexts; gender performance, including cross-dressing; and conduct books and other scripts written for the performance of everyday life. Prerequisite: a genuine willingness to learn Middle English. Since all primary texts will be in the original, an initial introduction to Middle English will be followed by weekly language exercises -- both written and oral. Students can expect to emerge as adept readers and performers of this rich and musical ancestor of our common tongue."

    :number: "050"
    :description: "This course is designed to fulfill one semester of the Georgetown College Literature/Writing requirement. It is taught in English and all readings are in English; it assumes no knowledge of French. The course combines the pleasure of reading imaginative literature with the need to move beyond the pleasure principle and take a more distanced perspective. Its focus is thematic and interpretive. The readings are selected from French, German, and English literature (20th-12th centuries); there is also a film. These texts are all linked thematically in that they are stories about growing up and finding one's identity. Growing up is a complex, mysterious, and sometimes arduous process that the hero/heroine experiences as a magical world where the natural laws governing human existence are suspended, the unexpected is bound to occur, and marvels are reserved for the chosen few. The choices to be made, dangers to be faced, and discoveries to be made, all help the hero/heroine relate to his/her own world and the conventional, mundane public world outside. Friendship, family, love, good and evil, authority and power, success and failure, responsibility, belief and knowledge and inexplicable mystery--these are essential experiences that structure and develop identity, in real life and in literature, today as well as yesterday. These readings are fantastic in both senses of the word: they create for their hero/heroine a magical world that is outside us readers and yet inside us too, and they are fabulous reading. This course does not count toward the French major or minor."

We will learn about the humanistic idea of the \xE2\x80\x9Cvirtuous man\xE2\x80\x9D and compare the political actors of the time (eg. the Borgia and the Medici families) to this ideal.

    :description: The role of religion in the political sphere is a matter of great moment in today's world. This course examines the historical evolution of the relationship between Church and State beginning in the Medieval World and moving into the Modern World, up to and including modern-day Christian fundamentalism. We begin with the moment that the Roman Empire became an officially Christian empire and then look at the evolving relationship of the papacy toward political power. By the thirteenth century the papacy had gone far toward becoming a papal monarchy over Christian Europe. We will then examine a variety of radical responses to a politicized papacy as well as the impact that the Protestant Reformation had on religious politics. Of particular interest are emerging ideas of the separation of Church and State and the novel concept of religious toleration. The last few weeks of the course focus on political writings from seventeenth and eighteenth-century Europe (most notably John Locke), the role of religion in the founding of the American Republic, and the political significance of Christian fundamentalism today.

    :number: "347"
    :description: In this colloquium we will explore the relationship of official religion to magic, approaches to the study of the natural world, and healing practices in Western Europe from late antiquity to the Scientific Revolution in the seventeenth century. Although the course will concentrate on ideas and events in Western Europe, important points of interaction between Christian and Islamic worlds will be taken up (the practice of alchemy, after all, received its name in the Arab world). Relying on historical documents and other evidence, we will place varieties of magic and superstition in historical context. Throughout the course we will examine underlying assumptions about God, the supernatural, the preternatural, and the natural. Because the role of superstition and magic receded -- but did not completely disappear -- by the seventeenth century, the course will address the reasons why much of what was normal and normative from antiquity to the Middle Ages became marginalized by the seventeenth century. At the same time, neither Christianity nor early modern science was intrinsically hostile to forms of magic; instead, both incorporated it in positive ways during their formative years. It is precisely this paradoxical combination of faith and reason on the one hand, and unreason on the other, that we will seek to understand in the course.

We will investigate the varied ways in which classic Russian authors and their readers (including our contemporaries, who grow up in Russia reading these works) pose the many convoluted questions related to the pursuit of love and happiness. How does one define happiness? What is a (or the) good life? How is romantic passion related to happiness and personal freedom? Finally, how do these authors perceive the role of society, gender, national identity, and religion within this complex equation, and how do those issues interact with the genre of the novel and the adultery plot?

  - :name: "Ethics of Life/Death: Middle Ages"
    :number: "111"
    :description: Ethical questions concerning life and death are of great concern to us nowadays. Is it permissible to execute criminals, to commit suicide, to kill in war? And if it is, under what conditions? These issues were the subject of intense discussion in medieval thinkers, from St.~Augustine in the late 4th and early fifth centuries to thinkers such as St.~Thomas Aquinas and others in the 13th and 14th centuries and later. Whether we agree with their views or not, their theorizing on these issues has deeply affected the way in which we think about these matters -- the distinction between just and unjust wars, for example, stems from them. This course will study medieval discussions of these issues. In particular, we will consider medieval views on the killing of animals versus humans, killing in self-defense, killing in war, the killing of criminals, suicide, abortion and contraception. The most philosophically rich discussions of these issues in the middle ages take place in the writings of theologians. The readings for this course are therefore drawn from medieval theologians and as such will make frequent reference to Christian teaching and scripture, although we will approach the material as philosophers, not theologians, focusing on the arguments presented for their views and philosophical issues they raise. At the end of each section of the course we will briefly survey some contemporary philosophical developments.

    :number: "167"
    :description: "In this introductory course we will examine some classic works of political philosophy including those written by Plato, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Mill, and Marx, as well as some more or less contemporary works by Isaiah Berlin and John Rawls. One aim is to learn to find your way around this field of thought, identify its main intellectual problems and solutions and apply its characteristic patterns of thought when reading new texts or understanding current political issues. The organizing theme is social justice, that is, the principle or principles for evaluating the assignment of basic social rights and responsibilities and the distribution of benefits and burdens of collective life. Every conception of social justice presupposes a theory of human nature \xE2\x80\x93 a set of beliefs about what people distinctively are and their characteristic excellences \xE2\x80\x93 and a social ideal \xE2\x80\x93 a vision of the aims of purposes of social cooperation and collective life generally. Another important goal of the course is to make explicit and evaluate these competing visions of human nature and the social life. We will also examine how these philosophers understand the fundamental political notions of democracy, liberty and equality. Throughout we will have an eye on contemporary applications of these notions."

  - :name: History of Ancient/Medieval Philosophy
    :number: "384"
    :description: "This course surveys some of the major themes of ancient Greek and Medieval Philosophy: Knowledge and Opinion, Being and Becoming, God and the First Causes, Cosmos, Soul and Immortality, Reason and Faith. The continuity between the two periods will be stressed. We will read works of Parmenides, Heraclitus, Plato, Aristotle, Plotinus, Proclus, Augustine, Boethius, Anselm, Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, and Aquinas.. Medieval Philosophy was born from the creative interaction of biblical faith with Greek philosophy. The issue, the relationship between philosophy and religious faith, is complicated because among western Christians, medieval philosophy mostly existed in the context of various theologies. But, throughout the course, we will consider the implications of \xC3\x89tienne Gilson's remark: \"A philosophy may draw inspiration from a revelation and be true, and if true, it is because it is good philosophy\" (Spirit of Mediaeval Philosophy [New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1940], p. 406). Until the thirteenth century, Neoplatonism (which attempted to unify the Platonic and Aristotelian traditions) provided the dominant philosophical framework for speculative theology. The most illustrious of the Neoplatonists, Plotinus (205-270 A.D.), profoundly influenced Augustine (354-430), especially in regard to the mind's approach to divine reality through interior recollection. Augustine himself dominated subsequent western theology, as can be seen in the writings of Anselm of Canterbury (1033-1109), until, in the late twelfth century, the translation and introduction of Aristotle into the Latin west provoked a philosophical revolution in regard to the prevailing Augustinianism. But the \xE2\x80\x9CChristian Aristotelianism\xE2\x80\x9D of Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), which marks a new stage in the development of medieval philosophy, was, in fact, a creative synthesis of the Augustinian-Neoplatonic tradition (especially as mediated through the Procline Neoplatonism of Pseudo-Dionysius) with Aristotle."

We shall begin with the twelfth-century renaissance, when cross- fertilization among Muslim, Jewish, and Christian scholars gave rise to new ways of doing Christian theology; we will study scholasticism and medieval mysticism. We shall also study the Crusades (the motivating factors, how they functioned in the imagination and piety of medieval Christian culture, their political and spiritual effects) and the fall of Constantinople in 1453. (2) Reformation. We shall study the Protestant and Catholic Reformations of the sixteenth century, studying not only the theology but also the social and political repercussions. We shall start with precursors to the reformation and then focus in particular on Martin Luther, John Calvin, the Council of Trent, and Ignatius of Loyola. (3) The Modern Period. We shall focus on problems of articulating Christian faith in the context of the modern world, its view of history, which seems inconsistent with revelation; its scientific methods; and its emphasis on the individual and individual rights."

    :number: "022"
    :description: "This seminar will consider three aspects of cultural formation in medieval cultures: ideology, violence, and gender. Our focus will be on two cultures in medieval Europe, which we will attempt to treat comparatively. The first is Scandinavian or Viking culture, encompassing the peoples of Scandinavia, Iceland, and (after the Danish invasions) England. In the Norse part of the course, we will study Nordic mythology and religion from Snorri Sturlusson's Prose Edda: the Nordic creation story of fire and ice, the world-ash Yggdrasil, the encircling world-serpent Jormungandr, the war of the gods and the giants, Thor, Oden, and Loki. Then we will read several Icelandic sagas from the Viking period--Njals Saga, Hrafnkels Saga, and Laxdaela Saga, the first forms of prose fiction in the West--and will study the evolution of Icelandic law and feud customs, and the role of women in Nordic society. The final work from this period is the epic English poem Beowulf, set in Scandinavia and closely related to the literature of Scandinavia and Iceland. Among the many concerns of this part of the course are violence and its role in shaping culture; honor, fame, and shame; the tragic nature of self-contradictory social codes; and societal self-destructiveness. In the material culture of the period, we will focus on ships and shipbuilding, slavery, and religious practice. The second culture we will focus on might be called \"romance culture,\" in part because it is largely confined to the romance languages, but also because literary \"romance,\" particularly Arthurian romance, is its characterizing genre. From France we will read Chretien de Troyes' Lancelot and Yvain, and from England, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. We will also read historical works to study the evolution of chivalric ideology as a major cultural phenomenon arising in part from the collapse of older feudal relations. This new ideology brings in its train at least two major formations that affected the history of Europe for 500 years: romantic love (and with it a new conception of womanhood) and knighthood (and with it a new conception of manhood). To study the new romantic love, we will read Andreas Capellanus' Art of Courtly Love. On knighthood, we will read selections from Maurice Keen's Chivalry and from the works of Georges Duby. The course will be conducted as seminar, with students taking shared responsibility for discussions. There will be frequent short papers and two longer papers during the semester, with an emphasis on the writing and revising process. This course satisfies the College's Literature and Writing requirement and is equivalent to English 022."

    :description: In this course we will explore the legends of King Arthur, the once and future king who has captured the imagination of authors and visionaries since the early Middle Ages. This course offers an introduction to medieval history, tradition, and literature as well as an analysis of the meanings and uses of Arthurian myths from the sixth through the sixteenth centuries. We will look at the social functions of the various forms in which the Arthurian stories appear--historical chronicle, narrative romance, prose and poetic formats, religious and mythic assimilations, and political allegory--as we search for the reasons behind the appeal of these legends. Analyzing the ambiguous relationship between history and fiction, we will investigate the growth of the legends as they evolved from early historical records and the first written versions of the Arthurian tales. Archaeological evidence and the records of RomanoBritish life will help us reconstruct the context of the earliest references to an Arthur figure. We will then follow the development of the legends as they were adapted to the political, spiritual, and literary perspectives of later centuries. The last few weeks of the course will be devoted to reading Malory's works in the original Early Modern English, with close analysis of Malory's borrowings from previous versions of the tales. Short writing assignments each week; two longer papers; final exam.

    :number: "222"
    :description: "This course offers a multidisciplinary introduction to medieval Scandinavia, from the creation of the world and the Norse pantheon to the discovery of the New World by Leif Eiriksson. The course is divided into three general segments. The course opens with readings from the prose and verse sources of Norse mythological and cosmological lore. Next, students will read Latin and vernacular accounts of the early (and fantastical) history of various Scandinavian tribes and their semi-legendary leaders, such as Beowulf and the Danish prince Amleth (Shakespeare\xE2\x80\x99s inspiration for his greatest tragedy). This image of Northern Europe\xE2\x80\x99s pre-Christian past as presented by subsequent Christian writers will then be contrasted with the archaeological record. The last part of the course will be devoted to the portrayal of the so-called Viking Age (8th-11th centuries) in the later Old Norse sagas, Europe\xE2\x80\x99s first great corpus of prose literature and the forerunners of the modern historical novel. At least half of the semester will be devoted to a careful reading of these seemingly straightforward but wonderfully complex narratives of love, adventure, and above all violence. Topics to be considered include the development of Europe\xE2\x80\x99s first parliamentary government (the Thing); the arrival of Christianity in the North; the legal status of feuding; the role of women in Viking society; the Norse interaction with the rest of Europe; and the discovery of the Americas around the year 1000. Requirements include several short papers; reading quizzes; a brief presentation on an artifact or archaeological site; and the choice between a research-based essay and a take-home final exam. Course Goals: 1. To acquaint students with the broad outlines of medieval Scandinavian history and culture 2. To familiarize students with several key genres of Old Norse literary and historical writing 3. To examine the material remains of Scandinavian peoples as evidence for a variety of social practices 4. To explore the interactions between medieval Scandinavia and its European and Asian neighbors. TENTATIVE TOPICS AND READINGS I. The World of the Vikings: Some Outsiders\xE2\x80\x99 Perspectives How did medieval non-Scandinavians characterize Scandinavian peoples, cultures, and the land itself? What biases does their reporting reveal? What do you expect to find in the native Scandinavian descriptions of \xE2\x80\x9Cthe world of the Vikings?\xE2\x80\x9D Readings: selections from Tacitus, Germania; the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ahmad ibn Fadlan, Risala; and Adam of Bremen, and The History of the Archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen II. Northern European Cosmology and Mythology Based on these mythological texts, what about Northern European culture seems to have been most important to the Northern Europeans themselves? How do these stories compare to Creation myths and accounts of the gods from other traditions with which you are familiar? Readings: selections from the Poetic Edda and Snorri Sturluson, Prose Edda III. Scandinavian Pre-History: Two Scandinavian Historians How do 13th-century, Christian historians represent the prehistoric, pagan past? How do they pay tribute to tradition while accommodating the new faith (Christianity)? With what biases do these historians approach their subject? What about the past do they celebrate or condemn? Readings: selections from Saxo Grammaticus, The Deeds of the Danes; Snorri Sturluson, The Saga of the Ynglings IV. Two Legendary Heroes: Sigurd the Dragon-Slayer and Beowulf What real social tensions do these fantastical accounts fictionalize? Can you identify an ethics of heroism at work in these texts? Which elements of that ethics derive from pagan tradition and which are colored by the Christian morality of the texts\xE2\x80\x99 authors? What is the function of the monstrous in these stories? of women? What is the significance of the reference to the legend of Sigurd in Beowulf? Readings: The Saga of the Volsungs; Beowulf V. Archaeological Evidence and Material Culture Do the material remains of the pre-Viking and Viking worlds agree with the written record of these societies? What can you deduce about traditional (pre-Christian) religion in medieval Scandinavia from this form of evidence? What do archaeological finds tell us about the Scandinavian presence in the British Isles? the Continent? Asia? What kinds of pastimes did the Scandinavians enjoy? Student presentations VI. The Dawn of the Viking Age What is a Viking? What are the proximate and ultimate causes of the Scandinavian expansion into other parts of Europe (and eventually Asia)? Besides the pillaging and destruction for which they are well-known, what achievements may be attributed to the Vikings? How does Iceland fit into the picture? How does the author of Egil\xE2\x80\x99s Saga (likely Snorri) depict the relationship between Iceland and Norway? How is England depicted in the two sagas? Are the sagas reliable as sources for history? Do the interests of the 13th-century saga writers intrude upon their narrative framing of 10th- and 11th-century history? Readings: King Harald\xE2\x80\x99s Saga; Egil\xE2\x80\x99s Saga VII. Law and Society in Medieval Iceland How is Icelandic society divided? How is Iceland\xE2\x80\x99s unique system of government a consequence of its relationship with Norway? What role does organized violence play in society? How does the law function as a preserver of social order? How can the law be manipulated and by whom? How does Christianity in Iceland compare to that faith as practiced on the Continent and in the British Isles during the same period? Readings: Hrafnkel\xE2\x80\x99s Saga; Njal\xE2\x80\x99s Saga VIII. Women in Norse Society What roles do women play in Norse society? In what ways are they depicted as acting independently in the sagas? What legal protections do they enjoy? When in the sagas do men\xE2\x80\x99s prerogatives and those of women come into conflict? How do the women in The Saga of the People of Laxardal differ from those portrayed in other sagas you have read? Readings: The Saga of the People of Laxardal IX. The Norse and the New World What are the proximate and ultimate causes of the Norse expansion westward into the North Atlantic? What kinds of settlements do they establish? Why do they fail? How do the sagas portray Native Americans? Why have Columbus\xE2\x80\x99s voyages eclipsed the achievement of the Norse in American mythology?

  - :name: Literature of Medieval Women
    :number: "253"
    :description: We look at the writings of medieval women and writings about them, considering the variety of cultures and cultural influences over the range of the European Middle Ages. Literatures from the British Isles, France, Germany, and Scandinavia are contextualized against and within cultural expectations of women under such influences as gender roles, religion, national identities, selfidentity and mythology. Choices vary each time, but characters considered can include women in the Welsh Mabinogion, the works of Chretien de Troyes, Beroul, Heldris of Cornwall, Chaucer and Dante, as well as the Irish Deirdre, the Old Woman of Beare, Brynhild of the Saga of the Volsungs, and Medb of the Tain. Selections from women writers will come from the dramas of Hrotsvit of Gandersheim, the Lais of Marie de France, the letters of Heloise to Abelard, Dhuoda's manual for her son, poems of the trobairitz (female troubadours), samples from visionaries such as Marguerite Porete, Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe, Hildegard von Bingen's accomplishments in word, illustration, and music, and Christine de Pisan's Book of the City of Ladies. Literature will be supplemented by outside material on historical backgrounds and literary criticism, most notably feminist theory and theories of representation. Please note that the reading list is very enjoyable but heavy; if you think the reading is too much, please reconsider taking the course. You write two 7-8 pp. papers, four response papers (2 pp.), and have a creative project due for a class party/medieval feast. No exams, but participation is vital.

    :description: This seminar will deal with the origins of Christian monasticism in the third century and trace its development down to the advent of the friars in the thirteenth. The course will concentrate on the relationship between monasticism and Christian society as a whole. What did the men and women who withdrew into the eastern deserts hope to accomplish by rejecting society? What was their role in the wider church? In other words, what were the implications for ordinary believers of having an alternative form of Christian practice develop alongside the Christian hierarchy? How was the monastic impulse transformed by its encounter with new political and social circumstances in western Europe? To explore these questions, we will read some modern historians, but we will rely heavily on primary sources, especially saints' lives and monastic rules, in an effort to understand how monasticism influenced, and was influenced by, the major historical currents of this crucial millennium in European history.

    :description: "Spring 2006 Only Professor Sebastian The Literature of Chivalry This course will introduce several of the greatest literary and cultural achievements of the Western European Middle Ages by asking students to peer beneath the surfaces of the medieval knight\xE2\x80\x99s perpetually shining armor and his damsel\xE2\x80\x99s proverbial distress to the politics of gender at play below. The class will explore the processes by which normative \xE2\x80\x9Cmanly\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cwomanly\xE2\x80\x9D behaviors are established and subsequently subverted in epic, romance, and lyric poetry; in treatises on the ethics of feudalism, chivalry, and courtly love; and in various forms of medieval performance from the songs of the troubadours to the great aristocratic tournaments. Secondary readings by current literary, historical, and cultural critics and by theorists of gender, ideology, and performativity will supplement and guide class discussion of primary texts (all in modern English translation), which may include the Song of Roland; the Nibelungenlied; lais by Marie de France; lyrics by the troubadours, trouv\xC3\xA8res, and Minnesingers; the Arthurian romances of Chr\xC3\xA9tien de Troyes; Gottfried von Strassburg\xE2\x80\x99s Tristan; Heldris of Cornwall\xE2\x80\x99s Romance of Silence; Geoffrey Chaucer\xE2\x80\x99s Troilus and Criseyde; Andreas Capellanus\xE2\x80\x99s treatise On Love; and manuals of chivalry by Geoffrey de Charny and Christine de Pizan. Students will be required to write numerous short responses to the primary and secondary sources; to complete a semester-long research-based project; and to participate actively in leading class discussion and shaping the progress of the course. Fall 2005 Only Professor Wickham-Crowley Literature of Medieval Women In this Gateway course, we look at the Middle Ages through writings by medieval women and writings about them, considering the variety of cultures and cultural influences over the range of the Middle Ages. Literatures from Britain, Ireland, France, Germany, and Scandinavia are contextualized against and within cultural expectations of women under such influences as gender roles, religion, national identities, self- identity and mythology. Outside material on historical backgrounds and literary criticism from multiple perspectives supplement the literature read. Active participation and keeping up with assignments is expected, and is part of your grade. You write two longer papers and several response papers, and have a creative project due for a class party/medieval feast."

  - :name: Medieval Sexualities
    :number: "104"
    :description: This four-credit course aims to better understand the variety of medieval sexualities from a comparative sampling of social institutions and writings. We will study depictions of sexualities and gender issues in various European literatures, classical and medieval biological and medical texts, religious thought and law, and the cultural variation present across the religions, regions and periods from c. 500-1500. Students might expect, for example, to learn more of Anglo-Saxon attitudes from penitentials, to think about the implications of Irish laws on divorce, to read courtly literature through the lens of contemporary medical knowledge, to weigh the impact of clashing cultural attitudes, or to consider the connections between prosecution of heresies and accusations of deviancy. You will be expected to work on smaller papers during the term, building up your understanding and learning to research sources in this field, culminating in a longer, final written project on a topic of your choice, developed in consultation with the professor.

    :description: "Spring 2006 Only Professor Hirsh A reading and discussion of Chaucer's great (if unfinished) master-work, the Canterbury Tales, a work of first importance to anyone who reads (or writes) narrative fiction. Students will read the work in original Middle English in which Chaucer wrote it, and discuss it in small and in large groups, focusing upon the work's narrative strategies, intellectual constructions, and artistic accomplishment. They will also write, in a variety of ways, about those aspects which particularly take their interest. Fall 2005 Only Professor McNamer In this course we will undertake a critical study of that brilliant masterpiece, The Canterbury Tales. By turns bawdy and lofty, racy and religious, hilarious and deeply moving, this collection of stories will challenge us to develop ways of reading adequate to its double status as relic of the distant past and as a text that anticipates many contemporary understandings of identity, meaning, and truth. We will read the Tales in the original Middle English, which is really quite easy; no prior exposure to the language is necessary. Requirements: 3 short papers (3 pages each), 1 longer paper (10 pages), frequent quizzes, and active participation in class discussion."

  - :name: Medieval Lyric Poetry
    :number: "116"
    :description: "This course offers a broad survey of the medieval lyric through the lens of cultural studies. We will take a pan-European view of the genre, reading not only lyrics from medieval England, Ireland, Provence, Portugal, Germany, and Italy, but from the rich Arabic and Hebrew traditions of Andalusia. Most of these lyrics are gorgeous, even at first glance; many also come across as powerful expressions of personal emotion that transcend culture, politics, and history. But our object in this course will be to recall that, however beautiful they may be, \xE2\x80\x9Ctexts are worldly\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x93 and thus to embed the poems in the historical, cultural and theoretical matrices that can illuminate their ideological operations as well as (and in conjunction with) their aesthetic complexities. Theorists such as Althusser, Jauss, Bourdieu, Butler, Foucault, Said, Zizek and Schechner will guide us we investigate, among other things, the function of the lyric in the production of subjectivity (including gender and sexuality), social relations, religious identities and cultural allegiances. Given the lyric\xE2\x80\x99s preoccupation with emotion \xE2\x80\x93 from the intense grief voiced in Marian laments to the erotic yearnings of troubadour song \xE2\x80\x93 our discussions will often center on the historicity of feeling: on how emotion is constructed and performed via the lyric, and to what social and political ends. Cultural transmission will be another focus, as we move from considering the interactions between \xE2\x80\x9Chigh\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Clow\xE2\x80\x9D cultures in the production and performance of the lyric to an extended investigation of convivencia among Muslims, Jews and Christians in medieval Spain \xE2\x80\x93 a \xE2\x80\x9Cculture of tolerance\xE2\x80\x9D created and sustained in part through the vehicle of lyric poetry. All readings will be in modern English translation, except for the Middle English lyrics. No prior exposure to Middle English is necessary."

    :description: "J.R.R. Tolkien was a medievalist and a philologist who, by writing fiction and poetry, created a world in which his languages could live. We will read widely in medieval works from Irish, Finnish, Old English, Middle English, Icelandic and French contexts, and examine Tolkien\xE2\x80\x99s biography, letters, critical and scholarly publications, and lesser known fictional works, all to get a better sense of what Tolkien knew and worked with as he wrote. We will read some of his scholarship, poetry, translations, draft work and unfinished pieces as well as the major works, The Silmarillion and The Lord of the Rings. Our interest focuses on Tolkien as writer and scholar. The culmination of our contextual study will be over five weeks spent on re-reading The Lord of the Rings. Students can expect to research and report on extensive supplementary topics on Blackboard, keep a regular journal, write a paper and finish with a substantial take-home exam. PREREQUISITE: You must have read the complete Lord of the Rings before the course starts. The text is simply too large (in all ways) for anyone who does not know it reasonably well to take this class, given the additional reading. I will be administering a test on the first day to ensure that you have read the book. Anyone who has not read the text at least once, as evidenced by the test, will be dropped from the course. Anyone trying to add into the course, in the unlikely event that a space opens up, will also take the test before being allowed to stay."

    :number: "324"
    :description: Before European expansion, the only comparable old world unification was the Mongol empire, which formed a bridge between Europe, Islam and East Asia in the 13th century. Though the Mongols are best known for chilling military efficacy, their legacy properly includes transcontinental exchanges of goods, technology, cultural material and geographic knowledge, as well as a lasting system of political legitimacy and imperial organization in Asia and a tantalizing glimpse of Cathay that spurred later Europeans on to exploration and conquest. Through readings, discussion, and viewing of cultural artifacts, this course considers the world the Mongols made and reflects upon its contribution to the world we know today. Primary readings will be drawn from The Secret History of the Mongols, the travel accounts of Marco Polo and of Ibn Battuta, the histories of Juvaini and Rashid al-Din, missionary accounts of Carpini, Rubruck and Rabban Sauma, and other texts.

Intervening topics include medieval heresy, civil suppression of heresy, judicial torture, and the Inquisition. Throughout the course, we will be attempting to define and understand historically such western concepts as social consensus, right authority, tradition, dissent, and heterodoxy. We will also be investigating the role that ideological uniformity plays in social cohesion and the extent to which opposition to orthodoxy is not merely to set oneself in opposition to civil and religious authorities, but also to a whole culture.

    :number: "374"
    :description: The Divine Comedy is the main focus of attention. How did Dante arrive at the complexly structured, polysemous vision he unfolds in the triform symmetry of Inferno, Purgatorio and Paradiso? How does the four-fold allegorical method of interpreting the Comedy, recommended by Dante himself, help us to understand the reality of life in 14th-century Italy. Is the reading of the Comedy an exercise in literary curiosity or does it possess the power to affect modern readers in our own lived reality? In order to address these and similar concerns, we will read translated selections from other works by Dante and his contemporaries and consider reactions to the Comedy from such perceptive readers as Boccaccio and T.S. Eliot. The Comedy will be read in its entirety in English translation. Conducted in English. This course satisfies one of the two literature and writing requirements of the College.

    :number: "375"
    :description: The Decameron, one of the most entertaining, beloved and imitated prose works ever written, is an accurate reflection of fourteenth-century life in Italy. Like Dante's Divine Comedy, this human comedy was written not only to delight, but also to instruct by exploring both our spiritual and our natural environment. Giovanni Boccaccio (1313-1375), considered by some typically medieval and by others one of the first truly modern literary figures to emerge from the darkness of the Middle Ages into the light of the Renaissance, shows himself, as author of The Decameron, to be both a passionate believer and a passionate critic as he reconstructs society, destroyed by the Black Plague, through the perfection of his 100-fold narrative. Class discussions will focus on a close reading of the Decameron. Special class presentations will treat questions of Boccaccio's belief system as manifested in the Decameron, his sources and his imitators, and the sociocultural milieu in which he wrote. The Decameron will be read in its entirety in English translation. Conducted in English. This course satisfies one of the two literature and writing requirements of the College.

    :description: "St. Augustine (354\xE2\x80\x94430) is a giant of Christian thought, but his profound influence on subsequent philosophy is often not sufficiently recognized. Augustine is one of the most frequently cited thinkers in the middle ages; in the modern period, Descartes\xE2\x80\x99s philosophy is thoroughly imbued with ideas from Augustine. The concern of this course is to explore Augustine\xE2\x80\x99s thought on a range of philosophical issues on which he influenced later thinkers and developed ideas that are important in their own right. These include freedom of the will and, more broadly, philosophical psychology; the nature of the soul and mind; the existence and nature of God; creation and time; knowledge and skepticism. Turning to areas of a more practical concern, we shall consider Augustine\xE2\x80\x99s views on happiness, the nature of the state, his contributions to the ethics of homicide, including the doctrine of the just war, and sexual ethics Texts & Readings We shall read a wide range of Augustine's works, including, but not limited to, \"On the Free Choice of the Will\", parts of the \"Confessions\" \"The City of God\" and \"On the Trinity,\" \"Against the Academic [skeptics]\", \"On the Happy Life,\" \"The Good of Marriage\".

Our focus will be on Spanish texts and their place within the wider literary and cultural tradition of medieval allegory. Readings from Augustine, Isidore of Seville, Boethius, Maimonides, and Alan of Lille will pave the way for our interpretations of vernacular works from the Iberian Peninsula, including El libro de buen amor, Raz\xC3\xB3n de Amor, Laberinto de fortuna, Visi\xC3\xB3n delectable, and Siervo Libre de Amor. These Spanish works will be studied in their intellectual, historical and cultural contexts and in relation to works in other vernaculars such as the The Divine Comedy, Romance of the Rose, and The Book of the City of Ladies. The class will be conducted in short lectures, student presentations, and extended group discussions (both in class and via Blackboard). Student responsibilities include active participation in class discussion, one bibliographic presentation, and a final research paper (10-15 pp for undergrads and 20-30 for graduate students). Students will be encouraged to apply the class's study of allegory to works in their own literatures and periods of interest in their final projects.

Our analysis of each mystic will be threefold: (1) we shall begin with her historical, cultural, and political context; (2) we shall undertake a close reading of the theological content of her writings and examine her methodology; and (3) we shall undertake a comparative study in which we consider such issues as religious authority, 'holy anorexia', and the role of physicality and the senses in mysticism."

These musics are considered sacred by the cultures that create or adopt them. What makes these sounds sacred? Is musical prayer universal? Can sacredness be lost through globalization?

This course examines the musical content and cultural context of sacred musics through written studies, recordings, first hand accounts of guest speakers, and live performances. Students explore sacred music from across the globe, including Western classical choral/orchestral music; Christian, Islamic, and Buddhist chant; the music of Sufi mysticism; Tibetan overtone/harmonic singing; Australian didgeridoo; Native American and West African drumming; and Zen Buddhist Meditation flute (Japanese shakuhachi).

Scholars and critics have approached Gershwin's life and music with a wide range of interpretive perspectives and analytic tools. This course will be less a biographical study of this musical enigma than an attempt to place him within the broader context of American musical life. We will use Gershwin as a starting place to explore aspects of African-American music, Tin Pan Alley song, Broadway musicals, concert hall performance, opera, Hollywood film, the piano, media and technology, and the issue of \"Musical Jewishness.\" By focusing on Gershwin, we will see how a single American composer can bridge many of the dichotomies found in American music: black/white, highbrow/lowbrow, and art/pop.

  - :name: Music and Dance in America 1932-1962
    :number: 038
    :description: This course covers one of the most vital periods of music and dance in America. Ballet, modern dance, theatrical dance, dance in the movies, and social dance were all undergoing great changes as well as burgeoning popularity; and there was significant overlap between types that are today considered quite distinct. Ballet pioneer George Balanchine and modern dance choreographer Agnes de Mille not only innovated within "serious" theatrical dance but also made dances for Broadway and the movies; Fred Astaire brought social dance to a highly polished theatrical level with both his sister Adele and Ginger Rogers; football and hockey player Gene Kelly turned down a position with the Ballets Russes and went on to revolutionize dance on film; tap dance was, like rock and roll, an product of American racial interaction. This was also a period in which social dancing was a major shaping force of popular culture, from the swing of the 1930s through the jive of the 1940s and a string of Latin dance crazes, culminating in perhaps the greatest dance revolution of the century, the Twist. Other key figures include Martha Graham, Bill Robinson, Shirley Temple, Sonja Henie, the Nicholas Brothers, Eleanor Powell, and composers Aaron Copland, Richard Rodgers, and Elliott Carter.

    :description: The songwriters of the publishing district known as Tin Pan Alley dominated American popular song in the first half of the 20th century. Composers like Berlin, Gershwin, Porter, Kern, Rodgers, and Arlen provided songs for Broadway, movies, swing bands, jazz musicians, and singers. The social and musical explosion of rock and roll in the mid-1950s has been seen as changing the music industry overnight. However, the change was much slower and more complex than this theory allows. In the late 1950s, a new generation of very young songwriting teams (Bacharach & David, Leiber & Stoller, Sedaka & Greenfield, Goffin & King, Mann & Weil, Barry & Greenwich) worked out of the "last house" of the Tin Pan Alley, The Brill Building, writing songs not only for Elvis Presley and Bobby Darin, but for singing groups like The Coasters and The Drifters, providing songs for the revolutionary new producers like Don Kirshner, and Phil Spector who spearheaded the "girl group" phenomenon with groups like The Chiffons, The Crystals, The Ronettes, and The Shangri-Las. Their production methods directly and indirectly provided models for the great recording companies Motown and Stax, as well as The Beatles.

    :number: "043"
    :description: "This course introduces students to the study of film as an art form. We will focus on the range of choices available to filmmakers as they compose and combine images, incorporate sound, and use film as a medium to tell stories, express ideas and present arguments. The films we study range across the history of cinema (1890s-1990s) and include films produced not only in the US but also in Germany, France, the Soviet Union, Japan, Canada, and elsewhere. This course defines cinema broadly and therefore includes documentary, animated, and experimental films as well as feature-length, fictional movies. While our focus will often be on the close analysis of individual films (considering them at the level of individual shots, individual scenes, the use of specific techniques), we will undertake this close analysis in light of the contexts (social, artistic, economic) that shaped specific film practices. Course requirements include attendance at weekly film screenings, exams, short writing assignments and reading quizzes. Note: This course has an attendance policy."

Its geographic scope comprises the central provinces and territories of the former Ottoman and Safavid empires: Turkey, Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Arabia, and Iran. The syllabus emphasizes three analytical themes: first, the historical evolution of \"Middle Eastern\" polities from dynastic and religious empires in the 16th century to modern \"nation-states\" in the 20th; second, the impact of industrial capitalism and European imperial expansion on local societies and their modes of production; and third, the socio-cultural and ideological dimensions of these large-scale transformations, specifically the rise of mass ideologies of liberation and development (nationalism, socialism, rights movements, political Islam), and the emergence of structural and social imbalances (economic polarization, cultural/ethnic conflicts, demographic growth, urbanization).

  - :name: Political and Social Thought
    :number: 099
    :description: "This course will be organized around two main questions: First, can a just and stable society accommodate a broad diversity--a pluralism--of religious and other views among its citizenry? Second, what are the principal constraints on legitimate rule? Augustine\xE2\x80\x99s City of God will introduce for us the first question, propounding an answer that is quite pessimistic as to the possibilities for a just and stable temporal pluralism; unity of a diverse people is possible, alright, but only in the Divine City informed by the true faith and graced by God. Machiavelli\xE2\x80\x99s Discourses on Livy will open the second question, with a resolutely secular renewal of the political ideals of Roman republicanism. Responding to the evils of religious warfare, Thomas Hobbes\xE2\x80\x99s Leviathan addresses anew the issue of religious diversity and seeks to locate a basis for political rule in shared human rationality. The remaining political thinkers we will read--John Locke, John Stuart Mill, and John Rawls--each develop powerful arguments for religious toleration (and other forms of toleration as well) and compelling constraints on legitimate government. In so doing, they bring us closer to the sort of pluralist democracy that characterizes the contemporary United States. In his most recent writing, as we will see, Rawls struggles with how to argue for the moral superiority of this kind of pluralism without taking just one more sectarian stance--without making a covert appeal to another \xE2\x80\x9Ctrue faith.\xE2\x80\x9D Assigned texts Augustine, Political Writings [PW] (Hackett).
