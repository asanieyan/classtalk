    :number: "100"
    :description: Using Latin America as a case study, LAS 100 offers students the opportunity to examine the images of the "underdeveloped" world that we encounter in the mass media on a daily basis.

Thus, students will "experience" Latin America through its images, but will be encouraged to analyze what exactly it is that is being "experienced." In doing this, we will be following current events in Latin America, and be making a critical, on-going assessment of coverage of those events in the mass media. The result is an effective introduction to the human condition and culture of our Latin American neighbours, and a critical glimpse at the limitations inherent in our view of that part of the world.

    :description: It has been recognized by various study groups that if teachers are not at ease with mathematics, their resulting fears and prejudices are communicated to the students. This course is designed to provide a direct experience of mathematics and to allow the students to explore their reasoning strategies and gain greater confidence in their mathematical abilities. Understanding of the pertinent subject material is essential to effective teaching. It must be stressed that MATH 105 is a mathematics course aimed at developing mathematical ability and is not a course in the methods of teaching. Topics include strategies in problem solving, sets and their applications, numeration systems, properties of real numbers and their subsets, number theory and plane geometry.

    :description: This course is an introduction to descriptive statistics, sampling, probability, estimation, hypothesis testing, correlation, regression, and analysis of variance. This course is similar to MATH 104, but includes multiple regression, one-way ANOVA, and a more detailed discussion of probability results. Facility with Grade 12 level algebra is expected, but no calculus is required. As a general rule, students with Math 11 are expected to take MATH 104, those with Math 12 are expected to take MATH 106, and those with a full year of calculus are expected to take MATH 270.Before registering, students should check the requirements of their program. UCFV mathematics degrees require MATH 270. While MATH 106 is not equivalent to MATH 270, students with credit for MATH 270 are not allowed to take MATH 106. Those with credit for MATH 106 may subsequently take MATH 270 in order to satisfy the requirements for a math degree.

    :description: Have you ever tried to figure out why someone's reasoning wasn't quite right? Have you ever had your own cherished reasoning demolished? Have your essays, exams, or lab reports ever been torn apart for being illogical? If so, you need this course. Good reasoning is the basis for successful thought and action. Good methods of reasoning help us to analyze an issue or problem, to assess various solutions, and to understand how to find the correct answer. In order to detect and avoid errors in our reasoning, we examine fallacies of reasoning, different forms of arguments, the concepts of truth and validity, proof and evidence, consistency and contradiction, definition and generalization, deduction and induction. Throughout the course, we apply our methods of reasoning to various issues, both practical and theoretical.

However, in contemporary academic circles, these commonplace assertions are actively questioned.

In this course we examine such radical positions as well as recent attempts made to redeem the concept of truth.
