    :number: 0814
    :description: Human hunters may have contributed to animal extinctions as early as 10,000 years ago; civilizations in the ancient Near East developed complex irrigation networks that led to some of the area's permanent deserts. Since pre-history, humans had an impact on the environment, but changes in technology have magnified the scale of human influence. Today, attempts at sustainable land use are often at odds with struggles for indigenous population rights, with population migration and increases in population size, or with desires to preserve areas for national parks or tourism, let alone attempts to exploit natural resources. Study the ecological principles underlying the relationship of humans with the environment and the explosion of conflicts surrounding modern environmental use.

    :description: This course may serve as a starting point for undergraduate majors in Visual Anthropology. Emphasis will be given to matching the diversity of American culture with a diversity of visual representations of American culture. We will explore how American culture has been visualized in mass media (feature films, prime time television (including situation comedies), daytime dramas (the soaps), comics, photojournalism, advertising, popular art, etc.) and home media (photography albums, home movies, home video, etc.). We will explore the thesis that American culture is best characterized as a variety of many cultures. Lectures, readings, screenings, web-work, field trips and assignments will suggest an alternative way of seeing what we have looked at all our lives.

    :number: "2361"
    :description: Starting in 1492, Native American isolation from Europe and Africa ended in the region of the Americas that became Latin America. Despite five hundred years of colonial and nation-state domination, indigenous peoples in Latin America continue to assert their basic human right to resist cultural hegemony. Not only have indigenous populations survived, they are also growing. Today they constitute a majority in Bolivia, Ecuador, Guatemala, and Peru and a substantial plurality in Brazil, Mexico, and Colombia. The focus here is on this remarkable struggle for physical and cultural survival. Attention will be given to the lived experiences of people struggling for human dignity on the lowest strata of regional class structures. Issues of land rights, environmental, health, political, and economic self-determination will be examined.

    :description: The first part of the course examines basic concepts, theories and methodology in the anthropology of culture, focusing on time and space perspectives on "meaning." Situating the anthropological enterprise in relation to, and as it intersects with, other disciplines, we will focus on issues of culture, history, and power, and we will also ponder on the unique kinds of knowledge that fieldwork produces. In the second part we will revisit these issues though case studies that examine, for example, performance, the senses, change, ideology, and identity. In the third part we will ask how culture, power, and history can be combined to understand, for example, the production of culture, especially with regard to representations of identity as they are produced and performed in contested cultural terrains by marginalized groups in society withim varying nation-state ideologies.Student will get an opportunity to experiment with short fieldwork assignments and anthropological critical writing styles.

    :number: "3310"
    :description: A distinctive contribution of cultural anthropology to the discipline and to the wider intellectual world is ethnography, a way of studying people in their own settings through intensive participant-observation and then communicating the results. Modes of ethnography have changed dramatically since anthropology began as a recognized field in the 19th century. In this course we will focus on different types of ethnography, particularly on how written ethnographies have changed in the last twenty years and how visual ethnographic modes have changed in number, style, and complexity. We will examine the impact of postmodernism and globalization on ethnography as well as its adoption by institutions outside the university (e.g., marketing research). Invited speakers, who are ethnographers, will present career information about ethnography outside academia. Readings will include ethnographies, novels and short stories by ethnographers, reflexive and autobiographical accounts by ethnographers. We will view a variety of visual ethnographic material including films, videos, still photographs, and web sites. One of the goals of the course is to enable students to learn how to communicate about culture, a skill valuable in college courses but also applicable to a variety of post-undergraduate careers. Individual research projects will allow students to develop their own interests from our shared base of knowledge.

    :number: "3331"
    :description: This course will examine change at the individual and group levels in various cultural contexts. What are the transformations that occur during rites of passage? Can we apply this same model to explain seasonal and calendrical changes? Who are the carriers of social change? Where can anthropologists focus to study change? We will explore various kinds of change, especially those brought by migration, colonialism, nationalism, and global capitalism, by focusing on individual and groups levels, by examining material culture as well as rituals and narratives, and by looking at official and unofficial practices. We will focus on the scholarship on ritual, performance, commodities, and the life history approach. Ultimately,we will ponder on the larger frameworks of value that make certain forms of change possible and explore their logic within a local politics of culture.Some of the topics we will discuss relate to the construction of individual and communal ethnic, race, gender, and class identities; vernacular religious change from rural to urban spaces; the commodification of ethnic arts and crafts; the body and house as sites that embody change; and the transformations of food, music and dance in traditional festivals andprocessions when they cross national borders. One of the goals of examining change processes in various parts of the world at various levels is to theorize, for instance, the effects of the global village, on the one hand, and multiculturalism and identity politics, on the other, on practice, or more generally between agency and structuration.

Native, minority, and elite visual texts from several societies will be compared with each other and with forms of pictorial representation in contemporary Western societies. The course first explores the emergence of non-professional models of indigenous expression in written forms focused on a reading of indigenous texts written by perceptive individuals. Second, we will examine pictorial forms by viewing and analyzing films and video programs made by indigenous individuals and associations. Examples will come from North and South America, Australia, and India, specifically the Navajo, the Inuit, the Kayapo, the Walpiri, as well as Indian and Tongan videography. Bio- and socio-documentary films made by American teenagers will be discussed; Anglo American examples such as snapshots/slides, family albums and home movies/videos will also be included in an effort to provide a comparative focus and global perspective.

    :number: "2011"
    :description: This course provides an interdisciplinary introduction to Chinese literature from its inception to the early 18th century. Some of the course's readings are drawn from works well known in the west like the Book of Songs, Zhaungzi, the poems of the Tang poets Wang Wei, Li Bai, Du Fu, and Bai Juyi, and the Song poet Su Shi, and short stories by the dramatist and novelist Li Yu. Other readings include works less well known in the west but long considered central to various literary and performance traditions by many Chinese. This course will present its readings with an emphasis on their cultural and historical contexts. Special attention will be paid to the place they have in various Chinese literary traditions and how these traditions have contributed to both Chinese ways of understanding their own cultural heritage and how they have influenced western understandings of that heritage.

    :description: What does a young, inner city, hip hop artist have in common with a D&D dungeonmaster? They share a life stage; both belong to a phenomenon called youth culture. Often rooted in gender, race, class, sexual preference and ethnicity, youth cultures enable young people to try on identities as they find their way to a clearer sense of self. Empowered by new technology tools--cell phones, ipods, instant messaging--and with the luxury of infinite virtual space, students will analyze the process of identity formation, heighten their ability to communicate effectively with peers and other audiences, and come to appreciate the forces and contexts that drive youth cultures around the globe.

    :number: 0822
    :description: Learn about the challenges of personal financial management in an ownership society. The idea that you should be thinking about retirement today when you`re just in college may seem premature. But if you are responsible for accumulating around $2.0 million by the time you retire, shouldn`t you understand the effect of delaying your investments until well after graduation when your career is established? In this course you will learn how to determine your retirement needs, how to think about managing risk in your investments, the issues involved in structuring a retirement portfolio, the role of the economy as it affects your investment performance, and the tradeoffs between active and passive investing. If you want to avoid being forced to wear an orange (blue or red) vest when you should be enjoying retirement, then this course should be of interest to you.

Therefore understanding the process of engineering is to understand the process of technological development. The engineer of today is either making an old technology better or developing a new technology. As will be illustrated in the readings, engineering is a human endeavor that has existed since the dawn of human kind. To understand engineering and its roots is to understand and appreciate one of humanity's greatest assets.

    :description: "Americans account for over a quarter of all fossil fuel consumption, own more cars than there are licensed drivers, and build new homes 40 percent larger than they did in 1975, despite shrinking household size. We feel for the pandas and polar bears, while contributing mightily to global climate change, resource inequity, and ecosystem destruction. How do we reckon with environmental crises at multiple scales, from the neighborhood to the atmosphere and oceans? \"Think globally, act locally\" environmentalists admonish us! Direct our vast human ingenuity and collective spirit toward technologies and behaviors that bring peace with the planet. Course mission: enhance your capability to make informed choices, based on a sound understanding of the ecological, technological, economic, political, and ethical dimensions of environmental sustainability."

    :description: Did an asteroid impact wipe out the dinosaurs? Can "natural" Earth-based processes also cause mass extinctions? Long before the dinosaurs, another mass extinction destroyed 90 percent of life on Earth, without an impact. Should we be less worried about rocks from space, and more about "down to Earth" phenomena such as climate change, volcanism, or disease? Basic geologic principles and the fundamentals of evolutionary thought combine to bring to life the 4.6 billion year story of our planet and its creatures. Through hands-on experience with fossils and rocks, students investigate changes in life through time, and discover how to decipher past environments from the geologic record.

During this period, Europe also made important advances in science, technology, the humanities and the arts that gave shape to the modern world. This course surveys these developments by drawing on the work of contemporary historians as well as a wide array of primary sources, including novels, memoirs, musical and visual materials. The course provides a basic foundation for further course work in any field of modern history.

    :description: "At the turn of the millennium, economic globalization is profoundly transforming many long-standing patterns of human existence. Public discussion about globalization, nevertheless, remains often shallow and misleading. This course aims to offer a deeper perspective on the present by examining the experience of the world economy over the formative period since World War II. It concentrates on two basic questions: 1) How did the domestic and global foundations of the current world economy come into being over the last half century? And 2) What are the implications of this historical process for our immediate and future lives? As an intermediate level course, it assumes no prior student backgrounds in either history or economics--only a lively interest in learning about broad historical trends and in developing intellectual skills. In addition to discussion, lecture, and common readings, methods of instruction in the course include use of a computer-assisted classroom to provide image and text projections, video clips, and internet linkages."

    :description: This course examines the roles that stereotypes, fashions, sports, the automobile, movies, radio, television, and leisure activities, have played in 20th century American culture, and the manifestations of political and cultural life that the artifacts and leisure activities of the average American exemplified. A knowledge of the history and development of poplar culture reveals the roots of modern American society and culture, and explains why Americans have not only developed in a unique way, but why their cultural influence has been so great on a global scale. As such, the course allows students to gain a broader view of American society while providing depth and clarity of understanding of it through areas not usually addressed by more traditional avenues of learning. Toward this end, students will write a research paper on a topic in popular culture using written, oral, and visual materials. Emphasis will be placed on the development of the student`s topic through an analysis of historical context, asking a proper historical question, analyzing multiple historical factors, and formulating historical arguments.

    :number: "1011"
    :description: This course will examine aspects of U.S. history in the 20th century through the use of public released feature motion pictures. In this visually oriented society, every student encounters images of history and culture on an almost daily basis. Critical thinking about the visual media must be learned. Every motion picture is a primary document that can be read, interpreted, and studied with as much depth as a written document. Because of their complexity, however, motion pictures reveal a vast array of contemporary attitudes specific to their period. A series of motion pictures will be shown illustrating different aspects of American history. As an intermediate course in the history department`s curriculum, the students will learn to critically examine these historical documents for different levels of meaning. They will analyze not only the surface plots of the films, but the underlying historical assumptions that provided the intellectual underpinning of the movies. They will write papers based on their abilities to analyze the visual documents and fashion an historical argument.

    :description: "This course examines historical developments in the office of the U.S. president from its establishment to contemporary times. Through lectures, discussions, class projects, and outside assignments, we will explore the historical literature dealing with the creation and evolution of the office; the presidents who have shaped the office; the powers and limitations of the office in both foreign and domestic affairs; the president`s relationship to the courts, the Congress, the people, and the press; and the broad political developments essential to our understanding of the place of the presidency within our changing political culture. This course asks: How has our most important national political institution come to be what it is? Two themes permeate the course: (1) what is the source and nature of presidential power? (2) who are the men who have held the office and why have they failed or succeeded? This course prepares students for further historical or other academic studies and for related professional careers in law, journalism, or executive management. More importantly, the course engages students` concerns as life-long participants in American democracy."

In short, the course will be rooted in specific processes in American history, but will examine how America formed groups that are given power and prestige, recognized as real Americans, discriminated against, marginalized, enslaved or killed. The groups to be examined include, but are not limited to, Blacks, Native Americans, Irish-Americans, Italian-Americans, Chinese-Americans, Jews, and Chicanos.

    :number: "2108"
    :description: This course will examine the changing perception and experience of growing up in the United States from colonial times to the present. It will argue that childhood and adolescence are social constructions that change over time.

Particular attention will be paid to the difference between growing up rich or poor, black or white, male or female, and rural or urban. Finally, it will consider the reciprocal relationship between popular culture and the lives of young Americans.

    :number: "2304"
    :description: This course explores Europe`s tumultuous history during the past century. Over the course of the semester, we will study important moments, stories, groups and individuals from this period, and try to understand why Europeans fought two devastating wars within thirty years, wars that reshaped modern world history. We will explore Europe`s gradual recovery from war and the paths it has taken toward unification and democratization. We will also think about different approaches to interpreting the past and what it means to `do history` or think historically. We will pay significant attention to the histories of Germany, France, and the United Kingdom and less sustained attention to other countries in western and central Europe as well as the Russian Empire/the Soviet Union. As a necessary corollary, areas and peoples outside of the European continent--specifically the United States and various former colonial possessions--will be discussed in relationship to `European history`.

    :number: "2317"
    :description: This course introduces students to new narratives of European nationalism and identity. The traditional courses on European history have relied on an understanding of European politics that divides the continent between east and west, and relies on Great Power perspectives. Using the concept of Central Europe, and the ways that it has been interpreted, this course encourages students to restore Central and Eastern Europe to the broader histories of the continent. Narratives of Eastern European peoples, Germans, Slavs, Hungarians, and others, were defined by the struggle between forces of nationalism and geopolitical realities, conflicting desires of sovereignty and security, freedom and social justice. This region, now part of the European Union, is rich in history and culture, as well as cultural and religious diversity. This course will highlight how East Europeans went from objects of high politics to subjects of European and world history.

What did the Revolution mean to the people who lived through it, and how might the answer be different for different groups of people? What was the relationship between the famous, enduring ideals of the Revolution and the realities of life in late eighteenth century America? And what kind of republic came out of the process? We will also consider the revolution as, among other things, a crisis in the first British empire, the creation of independent states and a nation, a civil war, and a massive slave rebellion, the aftershocks of which reverberated in the nineteenth century.

    :description: "The course focuses on two aspects of the history of the underworld of American cities: The first aspect might be called the life within the underworld, or what it means to live the life of a criminal. The course examines how bookmakers or madams run their businesses, how pickpocket gangs pick pockets, how loan sharks collect their money, and what kind of culture and social life characterizes those who are part of the underworld life. The second aspect is the way that underworld activities both reflect and influence the wider society. The course, then, examines the interrelationships of crime, on the one hand, and ethnic groups, neighborhood structure, urban politics, criminal justice institutions, the rise of professional sports, the changing sexual mores of the society, and even such aspects as the changing role of the family and the impact of technology. Crime becomes a prism through which students will learn about the history of American urban society."

Our emphasis will be on how women of different socioeconomic backgrounds, races, and ethnic groups have experienced colonization, American expansion, sectionalism, the industrial revolution, urbanization, immigration, war, economic depression, cultural transformations and political change. We will be looking not only at commonalities but also differences among women as well as the conflicts between women and a society based on male supremacy.

    :description: Whether a pick-up game at the local rec. center or a nationally-televised Final Four dream match-up, the game of basketball provides an ideal context for examining group dynamics, ethics, and motivation in organizations. For example, in basketball, the number one draft pick is only as dominant as the teammates (s)he electrifies. Think Michael Jordan and the notorious Chicago Bulls of the 1990s. Likewise, in a corporation, the CEO is only as effective as the top management team (s)he hand-selects and mentors to success. Ball hogs, showboaters, and cheap foulers can disrupt a basketball team's rhythm in much the same way that crooks, arbitrageurs, and balance sheet cheats can impact the bottom line. In this course students will explore - directly and metaphorically - some of the tenets of basketball as they relate to the theory and practice of management in organizations.

    :number: "2501"
    :description: Judaism is most often studied as a religious entity, despite the fact that much of Jewish experience does not fit into the rubric and discourse of religion. This course will consider the history of the concept "secularism" and its development in modernity, and will then consider what secularism has meant for Jews in particular. This is the first course of a two-semester sequence. It treats the emergence of Judaism and Jewishness in the modern world, up to the 20th century. Students will be introduced to recent critical work on the construction of "Religion" in the Enlightenment and with it, the "secular/religious" binary. The course will historicize and contextualize the ways that despite Jewish adherence to the notion of Judaism as a religion in the West in the modern period, Jewishness has always exceeded the bounds of this definition. Building on recent work by Baird, Pellegrini and Jakobsen as they rethink "secularism" for the 21st century, students will be asked to rethink Jewish history in other than religious terms. This new conceptual material will provide the framework for reading the classic texts of modern Jewish thought produced up to the end of the 19th century.

This course will explore Macbeth, A Midsummer Night's Dream and Romeo and Juliet, and their adaptation by composers and choreographers. Students will then get a chance to "bend the Bard" on their own!

    :description: Judaism is most often studied as a religious entity, despite the fact that much of Jewish experience does not fit into the rubric and discourse of religion. This course will consider the history of the concept "secularism" and its development in modernity, and will then consider what secularism has meant for Jews in particular. This is the first course of a two-semester sequence. It treats the emergence of Judaism and Jewishness in the modern world, up to the 20th century. Students will be introduced to recent critical work on the construction of "Religion" in the Enlightenment and with it, the "secular/religious" binary. The course will historicize and contextualize the ways that despite Jewish adherence to the notion of Judaism as a religion in the West in the modern period, Jewishness has always exceeded the bounds of this definition. Building on recent work by Baird, Pellegrini and Jakobsen as they rethink "secularism" for the 21st century, students will be asked to rethink Jewish history in other than religious terms. This new conceptual material will provide the framework for reading the classic texts of modern Jewish thought produced up to the end of the 19th century.

Virtually every employer offers some type of employee benefits in addition to salary as compensation for their employees. These have received increasing attention in recent years for several reasons including increased government regulation of employee benefit plans, increased cost of providing these benefits and increasing complexity of preserving favorable income tax treatment for these plans. We will primarily examine those benefits commonly known as Health and Welfare Benefits. These include the traditional benefits such as life, health and disability insurance in addition to dental, vision and prescription drug plans, HMOs, PPOs and other managed care systems. Emphasis will be on the design and structure of these plans, current problems and issues associated with the provision of these benefits.

The course will help these students build on their oral fluency in Russian to develop literacy in Russian. The focus is on the acquisition of contemporary standard Russian (Moscow dialect). Students who speak other dialects in their home environments will be encouraged to recognize the difference between their home dialect and CSR and acquire CSR in order to use it in professional settings. One of the most important aspects of this work is to develop sensitivity towards informal and formal speech and writing styles, since students without a formal educational experience in Russian may have little training to speak and write in formal (professional) contexts.

A psychologist might hypothesize that I.Q. is attributable to environmental or genetic factors; a politician might claim that hand gun control legislation will reduce crime; a sociologist might assert that social mobility is more limited in the United States than in other countries, and an economist might declare that globalization lowers the incomes of U.S. workers. How can we evaluate these arguments? Using examples from psychology, sociology, political science, and economics, students will examine how social science methods and statistics help us understand the social world.

    :description: Urban sociology asks how the physical and built environments, technology, population growth and shifts, governmental policy, and cultural and social organization shape the location and course of the development of urban areas. It focuses on urban America, although there is frequent reference to the development of urban areas elsewhere in the world in order to highlight commonalties and differences in the forces which structure urban life. Students research and write a sociological history of a block and census tract in the Philadelphia metropolitan area. It may be a history of the one in which they grew up, in which they now live, or another in which they have an interest. The objective is to combine quantitative and qualitative data to trace how and why the selected area developed as it did. A student will typically combine data drawn from several censuses with archival records to depict how the area changed in the context of the larger evolution of the community in which it is located.

    :description: "What is the digital divide and how is the Digital Miracle project impacting it? What can we do about increasing violence in our schools? These questions relate to a vast global change, and cities are its frontlines. There are more immigrants and more access to information, but there are also more problems: new kinds of poverty, increasingly separate lives, mounting intolerance. What does all this mean for how, what, and where we learn? How is education changing and how it can help fulfill the American dream for all the people in our cities? Working in teams, we will extend our classroom into the city`s schools, cultural organizations, and neighborhoods. We will find out who is doing something about the issues we raise, and bring that knowledge back in our worlds."

    :description: Development in Third World Societies has been defined primarily in terms of economic growth. Schools have been designed largely to support this process and serve the primary function of developing human capital. Similar patterns can also be seen in the United States. The course presents these and alternative definitions of development and the functions of schooling, and compares the experience of third world societies to that of poor people in the cities in the United States. While journeying through different countries, school systems, and cultures, the course also focuses on the `Third World` inside the United States. Here we explore how knowledge of Third World economic and cultural issues can help us understand the life and challenges of urban students from minority, working class, and immigrant backgrounds. Students also learn from experiences with urban and Third World groups with whom they are involved in service learning activities.

To others, it is an opportunity to re-examine American life based on new concepts about race, gender, and class. To others it implies the abandonment of the Western intellectual tradition. Some see it as a way to avoid dealing with racism in the United States by focusing attention on women, gays, the disabled, and white ethnic and religious minorities. This course will examine the current debate about diversity. We will focus our attention on cases that have been part of the controversy.
