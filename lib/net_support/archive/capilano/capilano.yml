Topics include the ethics of believing without evidence, arguments for and against objective reasoning, and the pragmatic justification of religious belief.

  - :name: Introduction to Formal Logic
    :credit: "3.00"
    :subject: PHIL
    :number: "202"
    :description: A standard introduction to the formal techniques of argument analysis. Formal logic was invented to mirror and evaluate mathematical reasoning and is now a separate branch of Mathematics. Our interest in it will, however, not be mathematical. Instead we will concentrate on the relation of formal logic to everyday reasoning and language in general. The course is essential for students thinking of majoring in Philosophy, but also very useful to Computing Science and Mathematics majors. It is designed to transfer to SFU as their Philosophy 210 (required for both Philosophy and Computing Science majors), and to UBC as Philosophy 302. There are no prerequisites, although students may find Philosophy 110 provides useful background. Please note that this is not an introductory philosophy course, but one which introduces mathematical methods of argument analysis. It is not suitable for students merely seeking a general understanding of what philosophy has to offer.

    :description: This course is an introduction to contemporary philosophy of mind. We will investigate the major philosophical theories of mind, but consider also if or how recent developments in neuroscience, biology, psychology, and the study of artificial intelligence influence the philosophical evaluation of these theories. Philosophy of mind is not psychology (although obviously there are connections). Rather, it is the attempt to understand what mental phenomena are and how they might relate to the physical (or material) realm. In the course, we will address questions like the following. What is the nature of mental states? What is the relationship between the mind and the body? Will a physical explanation of consciousness explain consciousness? Are 'zombies' possible? Is the brain just a computer? Is genuine artificial intelligence possible?

    :description: "Founded on a wide range of philosophical readings, this course will focus on questions such as: What is the good life and its relation to intimacy and family? What is the good person? Are there different models for different genders? What constitutes a good relationship? How important are mutuality, respect, affection, sex, and interdependence to such a relationship? What counts as equality/equity? How should the answers to such questions influence our views on such social issues as affirmative action, prostitution and pornography?"

    :number: "242"
    :description: "This course tackles a broad spectrum of questions and approaches the issue of human nature. Among the questions to be considered are: Are we, by nature, morally good or evil? Are we purely egocentric beings-biological machines of some sort - or are we spiritual, immaterial beings? Is there some enduring entity that defines the self? Are we free to do as we choose? Or are we essentially passionate creatures who act strictly on the basis of our feelings? Ultimately, our goal will be to learn to think critically and independently about these issues."

This structured aspect of society is comprised of institutions such as the family, religion, the mass media and education, for example, as well as rules, customs, laws, ideologies, etc. Our society is also embedded with structural inequalities related to gender, social class and ethnicity. Utilizing what has been termed "the sociological imagination," the course looks at how we are influenced by these aspects of society and in turn how we react to these influences.
