    :credit: "3"
    :subject: ARCH
    :description: "This seminar prepares students to evaluate and design environments from the point of view of how they interact with the human body. Tools and clothing modify that interaction. Semi-fixed features of the near environment, especially furniture, may have greater impact on physical well being and social-psychological comfort than fixed features like walls, openings, and volume. Today, designers can help redefine and legitimize new attitudes toward supporting the human body by, for example, designing for a wide range of postural alternatives and possibly designing new kinds of furniture. At the urban design scale, the senses of proprioception and kinesthetics can be used to shape architecture and landscape architecture. This course covers these topics with special emphasis on chair design and evaluation. The public health implications of a new attitude toward posture and back support are explored. The course heightens students' consciousness of their own and others' physical perceptions through weekly experiential exercises. Students produce three design exercises: shoe, chair, and a room interior."

  - :name: "Models of Cell Mechanics: Dynamics of the Cytoskeleton and Nucleus"
    :credit: "3"
    :subject: BIO ENG
    :description: The field of cell mechanics has recently undergone rapid development with particular attention to the dynamics of the cytoskeleton as well as its interactions with the extracellular matrix and how this interaction may cause changes in cell architecture, consequently leading to functional adaptation or pathological conditions. A wide range of models exist for cytoskeletal mechanics, ranging from continuum models for cell deformation to actin filament-based models for cell mobility. Numerous experimental techniques have also been established to quantify the cytoskeletal mechanics via perturbing the cell by exerting some sort of deformation and examining the static and dynamic response of the cell. These experimental observations along with theoretical approaches to the cell have given rise to several theories for describing the mechanics of living cells, modeling the cytoskeleton as a simple mechanical elastic, viscoelastic, or poroviscoelastic continuum, porous gel or soft glassy material, tensegrity network incorporating discrete structural elements that bear compression.

    :credit: "4"
    :subject: EA LANG
    :description: This course will explore how the Chinese and English-language literary traditions (broadly defined) delineate the realm of the ineffable, and how cultural notions of the inexpressible shape the writing and reading of poems, songs, and a selection of prose pieces, from the uses of figurative language and prosody to genre and canon formation. In addition, in order to deepen our understanding of how writing achieves its aims, some attention will be given to nonverbal modes of expression, including calligraphy and painting--and attempts to render them in writing. Over this course of study, students will not only refine their sensitivity to the power of artistic modes of indirection, but will also hone their skills in close reading, analytical writing, and oral expression. All readings will be in English.

The course will explore poetic translation, across languages, across cultures, and across historical ages, not merely from the perspective of the "accuracy" with which a classic text is represented in the translation, but as a window into the nature of poetic tradition and poetic writing itself. Works to be covered in the course will be primarily drawn from the Chinese tradition, but in the interest of allowing a comparative discussion of the course's central themes, a significant amount of reading, also in translation, from ancient and modern Greek poetry will be included as well. The goal of the class is not simply to gain familiarity with Chinese poetry and poets, but more fundamentally to gain skill and sophistication in reading, responding to, and thinking about poetry.

  - :name: Narrative across Learning Contexts
    :credit: "3"
    :subject: EDUC
    :description: The study of narrative has solidified into an important body of literature that is of particular relevance to educators. Across learning contexts, narrative is a ubiquitous literacy tool, and as such, it underlies many learning activities. We tell narratives for their potency to explain, rationalize, and delineate past, present, and possible experience. This narrative act is a collaborative undertaking, co-told and designed with the audience's input, addressing an audience's present and future concerns. Narrative can thus potentially create shared understandings and community among those participating in narrative activity, yet narratives can become sites for rejection and contestation. Narrative is also a socializing tool. The course will also address methodological approaches to the study of narrative that are relevant to the field of education. Students enrolled in this course are expected to collect narrative samples from naturally occurring interactions (video and audio-taped conversation, classroom interaction), written narrative texts, or other.

  - :name: Introduction to Convex Optimization
    :credit: "3"
    :subject: EL ENG
    :description: Convex optimization is a class of nonlinear optimization problems where the objective to be minimized, and the constraints, are both convex. Contrarily to the more classical linear programming framework, convex programs often go unrecognized, and this is a pity since a large class of convex optimization problems can now be efficiently solved. In addition, it is possible to address hard, nonconvex problems (such as "combinatorial optimization" problems) using convex approximations that are more efficient than classical linear ones. The 3-unit course covers some convex optimization theory and algorithms, and describes various applications arising in engineering design, modelling and estimation, finance, and operations research.

  - :name: Foundations of American Cyber-Culture
    :credit: "4"
    :subject: GWS
    :description: This course will enable students to think critically about, and engage in practical experiments in, the complex interactions between new media and perceptions and performances of embodiment, agency, citizenship, collective action, individual identity, time, and spatiality. We will pay particular attention to the categories of personhood that make up the UC Berkeley American cultures rubric (race and ethnicity), as well as to gender, nation, and disability. The argument threading through the course will be the ways in which new media both reinforce preexisting social hierarchies and yet offer possibilities for the transcendence of those very categories. The new media--and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester--can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

  - :name: California
    :credit: "4"
    :subject: GEOG
    :description: California had been called "the great exception" and "America, only more so." Yet few of us pay attention to its distinctive traits and to its effects beyond our borders. California may be "a state of mind," but it is also the most dynamic place in the most powerful country in the world, and would be the 5th largest economy if it were a country. Its wealth has been built on mining, agriculture, industry, trade, and finance. Natural abundance and geographic advantage have played their parts, but the state's greatest resource has been its wealth and diversity of people, who have made it a center of technological and cultural innovation from Hollywood to Silicon Valley. Yet California has a dark side of exploitation and racialization of many peoples, and of violent efforts to exclude immigrants and control the poor. This course pursues classic themes in geography, such as regional difference, the transformation of nature, the space of cities, and the changing landscape.

  - :name: "Nature and Culture: Social Theory, Social Practice, and the Environment"
    :credit: "4"
    :subject: GEOG
    :description: The relationship between societies and natural environments lies at the heart of geographical inquiry and has gained urgency as the rate and scale of human transformation of nature have grown, often outstripping our understanding of causes and effects. The physical side of environmental science has received most of the emphasis in university research, but the social basis of environmental change must be studied as well. Recent developments in social theory have much to offer environmental studies, while the latter has, in turn, exploded many formerly safe assumptions about how and what the social sciences and humanities ought to be preoccupied with. This seminar allows students to explore some classics in environmental thought as well as recent contributions that put the field on the forefront of social knowledge today.

First we grapple with what "value" means in volume 1 of Capital, paying particular attention to issues of historical specificity, abstract labor time, and the "value theory of labor," then we spatialize the argument by a close reading of David Harvey's classic, Limits to Capital. Next, we look at attempts to understand capital's relation to human action and other forms of value, specifically in anthropology and the work of Pierre Bourdieu. Finally, we take up the issue of scale in hope of formulating a coherent conceptual framework for integrating across scales, from the human-body (or even smaller scales) up to global economic, cultural, and ecological processes.

    :description: "This course will explore current issues in aging from biological, demographic, psycho-social, and policy perspectives. To begin, lectures will focus on: *The changing demographics of the general population of which older adults are becoming a larger and larger percentage; *How men and women age differently; *The historical context within which aging has been viewed; *The physical and mental changes that occur over time. These initial lectures will provide the foundation for the lectures that follow in which professionals present issues--unique to their field--that they encounter in meeting the needs of their elderly clientele. Representative professions will include law, medicine, dentistry, architecture, social welfare, optometry, speech and physical therapy. The importance of an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving will be emphasized as speakers highlight pertinent issues in this population through case study scenarios. By using case studies we will shift the focus from \"the disease\" or \"condition\" to \"the person.\" Speakers will discuss how they became interested in their respective professions and what opportunities/ challenges await a new generation of professionals."

    :description: This course will focus on the history of Italy during a period when it was the leading center of European artistic and cultural production and the driving force in the revival of classical learning and literary ideals.

At the same time, Italy was also a political battleground through most of this period, both in the realm of ideas and theory but also in a literal sense. It was in Italy that "the art of war," as Machiavelli called it, took center stage as the peninsula became one of the major theaters of war between the great powers of the age, France and Spain. The course will combine a study of the artistic, intellectual, religious, and political history of Italy in this period both as it developed internally and as it was related to the rest of Europe and the Mediterranean world.

    :description: In recent years, the pace of international transfers of technology, funds, resources, information, and even populations has increased dramatically. This cross-cultural diffusion has raised complex and interesting moral issues, issues which this course seeks to explore. We will examine some of the emergent ethical issues in international affairs, with particular attention to those involving technological development. Such issues include the effect of mass media and the Internet on cultural integrity, the politics of environmental regulation, ethical implications of genetic engineering, and others. In each case, the student will explore the relevant historical and empirical background as well as the salient moral and political debates. We will draw on classical, academic, and popular sources, including contemporary films, to explore the ramifications of such issues in modern culture. The goal of the course is to provide the student with an interdisciplinary introduction to key areas of conflict in the next century.

    :description: "This is an interdisciplinary survey course that seeks to understand how we define justice, evil, and individual responsibility in modern society. In particular we are going to probe carefully how humans reflect on and practice the process of moral reasoning. We will focus on human behavior in extreme situations: war, life and death conflicts, genocide and mass killing, as well as competing conceptions of human freedom. The course has a distinctive dual purpose. On the one hand we want to encourage the learning of critical thinking skills. This includes the ability to systematically evaluate information and competing moral claims. Also, it is intended as an exposure to the interdisciplinary approach. That is, how can different perspectives illuminate the same issue? With this in mind the course draws on important work from philosophy and ethics, social psychology, jurisprudential analysis, historical-political accounts, and personal memoirs."

    :description: This course provides an overview of Japanese literature and cultural history, from the seventh to the 18th century. 7A will begin with Japan's early myth-history, Kojiki, and its first extant poetry anthology, Man'yoshu, which show the first stages of transition from a preliterate, communal society to a highly developed courtly culture. Readings from noblewomen's diaries, poetry anthologies, and a selection of chapters from the classical Japanese literary masterpiece The Tale of Genji, offer a window into that courtly culture as its height of refinement. We will examine the intermingling traces of oral culture and high literary art in popular tales from the Kamakura period and explore the early representations of samurai heroism in military chronicles and medieval noh drama. After considering the development of linked verse in late medieval times, we will read several types of vernacular literature that emerged in the urban culture of the early modern Edo period, including the poetic diaries of the haiku poet Basho. This course does not assume or require any previous exposure to or course work in Japanese literature, history, or language.

    :description: This course is designed to introduce students to the history and craft of modern opinion writing. The primary goal is to help students sharpen their writing and analytical skills in a format that demands clarity of thought and economy of words. We'll experiment with voice and style to see how pithy, insightful, and profound we can be -- about big issues and small ones -- in commentaries on our own blog and in pieces we submit for publication. Columnists, editorial writers and OP-Ed page editors, and a radio producer will be popping in to critique our offerings. The first weeks of the class will examine the role media pundits, celebrity journalists, pollsters, and bloggers have come to play in shaping the country's political debate and policy choices. What credentials do these opinion makers have? Is their influence exaggerated by the politicians who seem so eager to curry their favor? We will raise and debate these questions and others about the media elite and that new realm known as the blogosphere.

    :description: Contemporary moral and political philosophy has been increasingly interested in how conceptions of the self relate to various aspects of our social and political life. These issues have an important bearing on legal theory as well. Law is shaped by certain implicit assumptions about the nature of individuals and collectivities, while it also actively participates in forming the identities of persons and in structuring collective entities such as families, corporations, and municipalities. This course will explore some theoretical approaches to this reciprocal relationship between law and the different social actors that it governs.

    :credit: ""
    :subject: LNS
    :description: Each upper-division course in this series deals primarily with the human events, institutions and activities of the past. Historical Studies are particularly important because, to paraphrase the philosopher George Santayana, those who fail to learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat its mistakes. The study of history provides us with perspective on the human condition and with an appreciation of the origins and evolution of the numerous cultures and social orders that have populated the earth. Whether students study history to understand how our world evolved from the past or to focus on the distinctions between the present and previous eras, they will come away with a richer understanding of and appreciation for human experience.

  - :name: Philosophy and Values
    :credit: ""
    :subject: LNS
    :description: According to Aristotle, every exercise of our faculties has some good for its aim. Every discipline taught in the College of Letters & Science has ethical implications, and to study a particular subject without considering these implications can be a sterile--and in extreme cases hazardous--exercise. The urge and ability to ponder such questions as the meaning of life distinguish human beings from the other animals. In an increasingly complex world, in which traditional values are often called into question, students of the College are encouraged to reflect upon their own assumptions as well as the assumptions of other times and cultures. In these upper-division Philosophy and Values courses students in the College will be encouraged to ponder the types of questions that will enhance their ability to understand their heritage, their contemporaries, and themselves.

    :description: Physical scientists seek to understand the universe, from its microscopic substructure to its largest structures, from our own earth to the edge of the universe and the beginning of time. Students fulfilling Physical Science breadth in the College of Letters & Science may be motivated by the pure pleasure of penetrating the mysteries of the universe, or by more practical considerations such as a desire to take an intelligent stance on such topics as greenhouse gases and space exploration. Whether students opt for the practical or the theoretical or a combination of both, students choosing a lower-division course in this series will learn to formulate problems clearly and think quantitatively, critically, and abstractly.

    :description: A tour of the mysteries and inner workings of our solar system. What are planets made of? Why do they orbit the sun the way they do? How do planets form, and what are they made of? Why do some bizarre moons have oceans, volcanoes, and ice floes? What makes the Earth hospitable for life? Is the Earth a common type of planet or some cosmic quirk? This course will introduce basic physics, chemistry, and math to understand planets, moons, rings, comets, asteroids, atmospheres, and oceans. Understanding other worlds will help us save our own planet and help us understand our place in the universe. Also listed as Astronomy C12 and Earth and Planetary Science C12.

    :subject: LINGUIS
    :description: Cognitive Science is an interdisciplinary field combining methods and findings from psychology, linguistics, computer science, philosophy, and neurophysiology to understand the nature of the mind. This course focuses on current cognitive science findings about language processing and explores how these findings can inform tutoring and tutor-training. Specifically, students will examine findings that will give them insight into the internal processes that underlie human langage in order to use this insight to improve their skills as tutors of non-native speakers of English. Lectures, presented by faculty from Linguistics, Education, Psychology, Cognitive Science and other departments, will cover specific foci within cognitive science that relate to education and language acquisition. Subsequent discussion sections will examine specific tutoring strategies that build on these foci. Students will then have the opportunity to apply this knowledge during one-on-one tutoring sessions with non-native speakers at UC berkeley's Student Learning Center.

  - :name: Harems and Court Cultures
    :credit: "4"
    :subject: NE STUD
    :description: This course explores configurations of gender and power in the royal courts of the eastern Mediterranean and Near East, and, for comparative purposes, in courts of China, South Asia, Mesoamerica, and Europe. So often imagined as a site of male sexual dominance, the harem is treated in this course as a mutable concept that sanctioned a range of gendered roles and identities. The term "harem" originated in the Near East, and for Europeans, the paradigmatic harem was that of the Ottoman sultan. But the broader question of the interplay among gender, the spatial dynamics of palaces, and royal power is universal. Themes considered comparatively include the spatial configurations of palaces; the status of non-wife (concubines and mistresses); patterns of recruitment to palace service; eunuchs as mediators of human and spatial boundaries.

  - :name: Human Rights and Global Politics
    :credit: "4"
    :subject: PACS
    :description: After World War II, we witnessed a "revolution" in human rights theory, practice, and institution building. The implications of viewing individuals as equal and endowed with certain rights is potentially far reaching as in the declaration that individuals hold many of those rights irrespective of the views of their government. Yet, we also live in a world of sovereign states with sovereign state's rights. We see everyday a clash between the rights of the individual and lack of duty to fulfill those rights when an individual's home state is unwilling or unable to do so. After introducing the idea of human rights, its historic development and various international human rights mechanisms, this course will ask what post-World War II conceptions of human rights mean for a number of specific issues including humanitarian intervention, international criminal justice, U.S. foreign policy, immigration, and economic rights. Looking in-depth at these five areas, we will ask how ideas about human rights, laws about human rights, and institutions to protect human rights have on how states and other global actors act, and how individuals have fared.

  - :name: The Politics of Displacement
    :credit: "4"
    :subject: POL SCI
    :description: Antebellum American political history generally follows a routine script in which the purpose of the Revolution was to liberate Americans for self-government and economic and social development. Slavery is viewed as an anomaly still needing explanation, and Native American relocation as the consequence of natural forces of immigration and pre-modern social values. In this class, the revolution against traditional political authority embodied in Jefferson's and Thomas Paine's attack on the British crown, the rise of slavery, and the conflict with Native America are seen as coherent parts of a cultural and social development that emerges in the 18th- and 19th-century America. Using both original antebellum materials, including biographies, history, and literature, and contemporary images from American popular culture such as film, news and magazine articles, and music, we will compare and contrast the experiences of antebellum Native Americans, Euopean imiiigrants, and African slaves as a connection between the past and the present emerges.

    :credit: "4"
    :subject: POL SCI
    :description: What is governance? How should we explain its emergence? What are its implications for public policy and democracy? This course uses debates about contemporary governance to examine four approaches to political science and political theory. The approaches are rational choice theory, institutionalism, Marxism, and poststructuralism. The course looks at the narrative that each approach provides of the origins and workings of governance since 1979, and at the way these narratives embody theoretical commitments about rationality and power, structure and agency, and democracy. It thus promotes an awareness of the way questions about contemporary governance are inextricably linked to philosophical and normative commitments. This course has a required discussion section.

    :subject: POL SCI
    :description: "The course will examine three American cultural forms. The focus of the course is to be comparative; readings will center around first-person accounts, written by members of the ethnic groups most immediately involved in each of the cultural forms. The theme is that of identity, seen politically as well as culturally: examining how the various ethnic groups involved came to forge a collective identity for themselves. The three groups studied will vary by instructor. See departmental listings for more specific information."

  - :name: Politics of European Integration
    :credit: "4"
    :subject: POL SCI
    :description: The European Union is the world's most advanced experiment in governance beyond the level of the traditional nation-state. As France, Britan, Germany, Spain, Poland, and the other main member states have pooled their sovereignty, they have created new ways of organizing the realities of economic competition, political authority, social cohesion, and cultural identity. Not surprisingly, there are several divisions among social scientists who study Europe. Specialists in comparative politics focus primarily on workings of national political economies, while scholars in international relations devote most of their attention to the construction of supranational institutions. Economists are especially interested in Europe's internal trade regime and currency arrangements. Sociologists and anthropologists have meanwhile focused growing attention to transnational interest groups, religion, and identity. The course seeks to bridge the intellectual divide between these different approaches by examining economic, political, and cultural aspects of integration. Readings are drawn primarily from the fields of international relations, comparative politics, and public policy.

    :description: This course is an introduction to public international law for students of international relations. The primary purpose of this course is to enhance students' understanding of the ways in which international law orders international politics. How and to what extent has it been used in resolving conflicts between nations? How and to what extent has it facilitated the achievement of common goals? What is the relationship between international law and states' foreign policies? Emphasis throughout the course is on the substantive rules of the law, the relationship between law and politics, and on historical episodes that illustrate the issues. Substantive areas include international human rights, international trade law, and international law and the use of force.

  - :name: "International Law: Theory and Research"
    :credit: "4"
    :subject: POL SCI
    :description: "The purpose of this course is to explore in greater depth the effect that international law has on the conduct of foreign relations and on international outcomes. After a brief review of some of the principles of international law, the course will turn to the more theoretical question of why states increasingly have turned to agreements in legal form to order their relations, and to what extent legalized agreements influence state behavior. Since states are the primary subjects of international law, the course will focus on their motives and choices, but attention will be paid to the context in which governments make decisions within the constraints of law. Therefore, we will consider the role domestic politics, transnational actors (corporations, non-governmental organizations), and domestic courts may have in using law to accomplish their purposes. The course will focus on three substantive issues areas: international trade, international human rights, and territorial claims."

  - :name: Governance of the E-conomy
    :credit: "4"
    :subject: POL SCI
    :description: New digital technologies, changing market structures, and innovative business organizations are transforming the economic and social landscape of the advanced industrial countries. The policy issues associated with this transformation pose fundamental philosophical and political questions of how to organize our markets, polity, and society. The means of making and implementing these choices is politics. The necessarily global scope of the E-conomy extends the political and policy challenges to the international arena. This course will explore the literature on the political economy of the Internet to determine what policy choices -- hence which political debates -- are and will be most important. We also will examine our conceptual understanding of the burgeoning digital economy and its impact on politics, law, and socio-economic relations.

    :credit: "4"
    :subject: POL SCI
    :description: In the present era political, economic, and social organization powerfully influence national capacity to assure economic success, real and rising incomes for the population, and political success, basic survival, and the projection of its purposes and values. This course looks at the continual process of international competition and transformation, and examines which factors separate the winners from the losers. We will gain leverage into these questions by examining critical moments in the 20th and 21st centuries and analyze according to national responses. What choices signal success? Can the failures be avoided? The course will discuss whether globalization is shunting aside national political choice, or whether globalization is in fact a sequence of national and regional stories played out on a larger stage. We will consider how economic constraint structures political choice and national response to the global economy. But we will also examine how political developments shape market dynamics and national innovations. We will learn about all sorts of things from the politics of French fashion to why Japanese make good cars.

    :credit: "4"
    :subject: POL SCI
    :description: This seminar compares alternative approaches to the institutional arrangements that are shaping competition in the advanced countries. Debates in political economy, sociology, and the economics of organization show that industrial democracies are experimenting with new rules and frameworks by which they grovern themselves and coordinate economic activity. Comparative analysis shows that a range of governance mechanisms -- networks, associations, regions, and federal systems of coordination -- are evolving alongside markets as practical forms of forms for organizing economic and political competition. Collective choices among these different arrangements are complex and contested, because different groups place different value on the goals of economic efficiency and growth on the one hand, political accountability and autonomy on the other.

    :description: With changes in technology, the internationalization of production and the massive increase in trans-border transactions of all kinds, it has been argued that we live and work in an era of substantively different capitalism. Were this true, it has deep implications for politics and for political economy. This graduate seminar explores the validity of this claim of a "new capitalism" through a variety of materials, starting with the question of whether "Fordism" ever existed, moving on to the question of whether "Post-Fordism" exists and ending with a variety of ethnographic studies that show how global production chains shape culture, gender, and hieraarchy/power.

    :description: This new course will enable students to think critically about, and engage in practical experiments in, the complex interactions between new media and perceptions and performances of embodiment, agency, citizenship, collective action, individual identity, time and spatiality. We will pay particular attention to the categories of personhood that make up the UC Berkeley American Cultures rubric (race and ethnicity), as well as to gender, nation, and disability. The argument threading through the course will be the ways in which new media both reinforce pre-existing social hierarchies, and yet offer possibilities for the transcendence of those very categories. The new media -- and we will leave the precise definition of the new media as something to be argued about over the course of the semester -- can be yet another means for dividing and disenfranchising, and can be the conduit of violence and transnational dominance.

  - :name: "Multiple Testing and Loss Function Based Estimation: Applications in Biological Sciences"
    :credit: "3"
    :subject: PB HLTH
    :description: Statistical computer-intensive methods have become an integral part of the analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies involving the collection of genomic data such as gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism, and comparative genomic hybridization measurements across the whole genome. These data structures are extremely high dimensional and the characteristics (parameters of interest) of the population are complex (high dimensional), and outcomes such as survival are often subject to censoring. In addition, one often aims to learn and test many univariate characteristics simultaneously (e.g., regression coefficient for each gene). This course will present (1) a unified loss-function-based approach to learning from the data such characteristics which relies on general cross-validation methodology to select among candidate estimators, (2) resampling-based multiple testing methods controlling type I errors, and (3) clustering methods embedded into a statistical framework.

    :description: "This seminar brings together two related frames for policy thinking: the ethics of policy, that is, what does it mean to do the right thing? and the intervention of policy, that is, how do new policy paradigms emerge? Ethics: Those who seek to govern well inescapably confront questions of value in their political, professional, and personal choices. the discussion of ethical dilemmas, which will take up the first half of the semester, is designed to provoke analytic reflection on the moral challenges and responsibilities of public policymaking in a democracy. The focus is on the many and often competing obligations, commitments and values that should guide public actors, as well as on the public principles that guide the design of good public policy. Big Ideas: Politics and conventional analytics dominate policy in the short run. But over the longer term, conceptualizations as varied as exit/voice/loyalty, satisficing, the tipping point, memes, winner-take-all, strong democracy, broken windows, and the prisoners dilemma profoundly influence the policy conservation."

    :credit: "4"
    :subject: RELIGST
    :description: This course examines the diversity of American religious traditions as seen through the experience of some of its major racial, ethnic, and immigrant communities. Since ethnicity and issues of race play a defining role in the development of these religious communities, the theoretical focus of this course will center on the tensions racial and cultural differences created, the ways these communities addressed their cultural alienation, and the means they used to ease such tensions.

    :credit: "2"
    :subject: SOC WEL
    :description: The United States is a nation of immigrants. Today, one of every nine Americans and one of every four Californians is an immigrant. Social workers need to acquire skills to serve this population. One significant problem that faces immigrant families is the development of intergenerational/intercultural conflict that occurs as a result of the differential acculturation between parents and their children. Its occurence has been documented in virtually every group of immigrants and refugees, and research has demonstrated that this conflict results in poor mental health for both parents and children. Strengthening Intergenerational/intercultural Ties in Immigrant Families (SITIF) is one of the very few empirically demonstrated interventions that exist to ameliorate this problem. This 10-week, 24-hour intervention is intended for use with immigrants from any ethnic background and may be administered in either a group or individual format. The course trains students to use SITIF effectively in their work with immigrant families.

  - :name: "Multiple Testing and Loss Function Based Estimation: Applications in Biological Sciences"
    :credit: "3"
    :subject: STAT
    :description: Statistical computer-intensive methods have become an integral part of the analysis of cross-sectional and longitudinal studies involving the collection of genomic data such as gene expression, single nucleotide polymorphism, and comparative genomic hybridization measurements across the whole genome. These data structures are extremely high dimensional and the characteristics (parameters of interest) of the population are complex (high dimensional), and outcomes such as survival are often subject to censoring. In addition, one often aims to learn and test many univariate characteristics simultaneously (e.g., regression coefficient for each gene). This course will present (1) a unified loss-function-based approach to learning from the data such characteristics which relies on general cross-validation methodology to select among candidate estimators, (2) resampling-based multiple testing methods controlling type I errors, and (3) clustering methods embedded into a statistical framework.
