    :description: "This seminar course examines diverse postwar experiences and realities of the Asia Pacific region, which comprises a range of countries that differ in cultural, ethnic, and religious backgrounds, in levels of social and economic developments, and in political regimes. Unlike Europe, which has gone through a steady process of integration since WWII, regional links among Asia Pacific countries have been rather weak and often limited. Attempts to forge regional economic cooperation within the Asia Pacific region, such as ASEAN, have been fraught with political and historical tensions. As a result, much of the linkage has been limited to investment, trade, and production networks. This seminar will examine the various social, economic, and political experiences and realities of the countries in this region and their implications.

Within this context, stratospheric ozone depletion, ocean chemistry, urban air pollution, acid rain and water quality are also discussed. The second semester focuses on the solid Earth: its formulation and evolution, internal dynamics, mantle-core differentiation, volcanism, tectonics and paleoclimate/ice ages. Throughout the course, the operation of the Earth as a coupled physico-chemical system over a range of timescales is emphasized.

We look to generate knowledge and understanding about: 1) the manner in which Latina/o diasporas have been constructed through historical and socio-political processes such as exile, migration, immigration, and the ways in which they are articulated within transnational processes of capital accumulation and the redefinitions of &#145;authentic&#146; national subjecthood and, 2) the ways in which Latinidad emerges both within Latina/o communities and in relation to the Canadian nation and transnational realities.

    :credit: "0.5"
    :description: "The universe is not a rigid clockwork, but neither is it formless and random. Instead, it is filled with highly organized, evolved structures that have somehow emerged from simple rules of physics. Examples range from the structure of galaxies to the pattern of ripples on windblown sand, to biological and even social processes. These phenomena exist in spite of the universal tendency towards disorder. How is this possible? Self-organization challenges the usual reductionistic scientific method, and begs the question of whether we can ever really understand or predict truly complex systems.
