    :description: (3 cr. hrs.) This is the new "gateway" course into the interdisciplinary American Studies undergraduate curriculum. Using film, art, literature, history, music, food, and culture, students will compare and contrast ideas about citizenship, national identity, and the social contract in the broader Americas, focusing on the most basic building blocks of the national identity and the formal terms of membership in civil society. What makes a person a United States citizen? A Mexican citizen? A Brazilian citizen? A Canadian citizen? What, moreover, is an 'American'? How broadly can we use this term? And how narrowly? Is there such a thing as a 'Pan-American' identity? What does the United States shares with Central and South America? Or with Canada and the Caribbean? Lastly, how can we best answer these questions using high art, popular culture, and other cultural forms?

    :description: "(3 cr. hrs.) A & H In recent years, the question of American borders and identities has occupied center stage in U.S. media and politics; think of the post- 9/11 rush to find ways of securing U.S. national borders or the most recent debates about immigrants and immigration. Yet how we map the United States (and how we define the national community that is contained within these borders) have been fraught discussions throughout U.S. history. In this course, we will compare a diverse array of cultural works that examine what it means to live within, without, or even on U.S. borders. One of our broader objectives will be to situate our examination of U.S. borders and communities in larger contexts; we will work hard to think beyond the U.S. to sites such as the greater Americas, Asia, or the Middle East, and we will also strive to analyze these works comparatively. We will frame our discussions with some key questions: According to these works, what is at stake in creating, defining, and redefining borders and communities? How does each work define these communities through boundaries of race, nation, region, class, gender, and sexualities? How do these works imagine transgressing borders? What are the challenges, problems, or potentials in such crossings? A sampling of selected topics and works includes the nineteenth- century South (Mark Twain\x92s Puddn\x92head Wilson); Muslim communities in Indiana (Mohja Kahf\x92s 2006 novel, Girl in a Tangerine Scarf); a 1930s Cuban community in Florida (Nilo Cruz\x92s play Anna in the tropics); Filipina and Filipino youth in Hawaii (R. Zamora Linmark\x92s short stories); the urban spaces of Los Angeles (the film version of Anna Deveare Smith\x92s play, Twilight) and Chicago (LeAlan Jones and Lloyd Newman\x92s public-radio broadcasts and the corresponding text version, Our America); and the global collapse of borders and national communities (the 2006 film, Babel, written by Guillermo Arriaga and directed by Alejandro Gonz\xE1lez I\xF1\xE1rritu). Course requirements will most likely include one group project/presentation, a midterm, 2 formal papers, active class participation and attendance, and written responses"

    :description: "(3 cr. hrs.) A & H This course examines the dynamics of race and labor through the rural and urban comparative lived experiences of a variety of different groups, including Mexican braceros, Latino \x93Zoot Suiters\x94 African American industrial workers, Victory Farm Volunteers, the Women\x92s Land Army, Japanese internees, and Jamaican and Filipino farm workers. Critical questions will shape our exploration of race and labor over the course of the semester: How is race defined during wartime? Is there a relationship between race and labor, and if so, what is it? How could we characterize the lived experiences of these different groups? How were they similar? How were they different? Designed to reflect the complexity of human experience and thought, this course allows students to grapple with issues associated with race and labor within the context of a global war in a variety of urban and rural settings. Through an interdisciplinary theoretical framework which fuses American Studies, History, Journalism, Literature and Anthropology with a distinctively ethnohistorical methodology, this course utilizes written texts, novels, visual arts, music, and other performing arts, wartime propaganda, and governmental reports to foster the growth of interpretive and critical skills. An understanding of the dynamics of race and labor must be grounded in an examination of the world of individuals going about their business and in the communities in and out of which they move. The assignments in the class reflect this goal, both in the readings and through the development of ethnohistorical skills of analysis."

    :description: "(3 cr. hrs.) A & H 2nd 8 weeks course Topic: Cultural Paranoia & the Contemporary Hollywood Misdirection Film Instructor: Seth Friedman (seafried@indiana.edu) Location WH 121 2:30 - 4:25 p.m. Mondays & Wednesdays Weekly film screenings BH 006 7:00 - 10:00 p.m. Wednesdays Since the early 1990s, there has been a spate of Hollywood films such as The Sixth Sense (1999), The Usual Suspects (1995), and Fight Club (1999), which are renowned for their surprise endings. All these films possess a similar narrative structure; they each contain a revelation that encourages spectators to reinterpret retrospectively all that has come before. Although these films can be identified as belonging to other pre-existing industrially recognized genres, this class will take the approach that they are more appropriately categorized as constituents of the \x93misdirection\x94 genre. This is because the narrative revelation is the most consistently referenced feature whenever people speak or write about these films, regardless of the ways that the studios package them. This class will investigate the reasons why this long-standing narrative mode has proliferated in the U.S. over the past two decades. It is significant that some U.S. audiences have been drawn to films that demand greater interpretive work than what is typically needed to decipher the standard Hollywood fare. To address this apparent paradox, we will examine the socio-cultural and industrial conditions that have made misdirection films attractive to both Hollywood producers and some U.S. audiences over approximately the past twenty years. We will attempt to determine why an audience for these films has recently formed. Specifically, we will address why films containing narratives that suggest that the \x93truth\x94 is being concealed from view have become so appealing to a significant segment of U.S. spectators. We will focus on questions such as the following: What relationship do films and other forms of media have to the culture in which they are produced and consumed? What can the popularity of contemporary misdirection films tell us about the acceptability of different modes of interpretation in the U.S. since the early 1990s? How do communities form from specific interpretive practices? What can these films tell us about contemporary racial and gender politics in the U.S.? What connection do these films have to the development of new home-viewing technologies, the rise of the Internet, and other recent changes impacting the U.S. media industries? To help us respond to these questions, we will read selections from a variety of disciplines such as Anthropology, Film and Media Studies, History, Literary Studies, and Political Science. Films will likely include the following: Arlington Road (1999), Fight Club (1999), Jacob\x92s Ladder (1990), Magnolia (1999), Memento (2000), Mulholland Drive (2001), Primal Fear (1996), Psycho (1960), The Shining (1980), The Sixth Sense (1999), Unbreakable (2000), and The Usual Suspects (1995)."

    :description: "(3 cr. hrs.) A & H How is pregnancy and childbirth visually grappled with in our culture? What do representations of pregnancy and childbirth reveal about cultural attitudes, social expectations and individual experiences of reproduction? The aim of this course is to provide an in-depth exploration of visual representations of pregnancy and childbirth as they are informed by particular childbirth practices in the United States. From pregnant and birthing images found in photography and television to those in painting, sculpture and film, this class will examine how these images reflect, reinforce or revolutionize cultural anxieties surrounding the maternal body. Situated in the context of medicalization and midwifery, childbirth and it accompanying images will be explicated by contrasting themes: birth in the hospital versus the home, medical knowledge versus bodily knowledge, fetal imagining and fragmentation of the mother versus mother-centered discourses, and technocratic versus natural or holistic models of the body. Class material and discussions will be driven by three basic questions: 1) How is pregnancy and childbirth visually grappled with in our culture? 2) What aesthetic choices, visual themes and theoretical problems arise from the visual subject of childbirth? and 3) How might these image texts reflect, reinforce or revolutionize cultural anxieties surrounding the pregnant/birthing/maternal body? The goal of this class is to offer insight into the social and medical discourses of the body that shape the treatment of women and their partners in the hospital birth setting, and to offer an alternative."

The intersection between the non-human species and the foreigner will introduce the dominant themes associated with the trope of the alien. Among these recurrent themes are invasion, subversion, and exoticism. Representations of the alien in popular culture often require knowing and controlling this figure. This class interrogates the assumptions and meanings of these representations: Who or what are aliens? What do they want? Can we live with them? What is their social significance? How do they challenge our understanding of self and the other? By questioning the language, images, and attitudes presented in film, songs, sitcoms, reality shows, literature, comic strips, and newspaper clips, students learn to critique the signs and symbols of the world they inhabit."

Second, we will analyze the linkages between private and public\x97between individual identity and experience on one hand and politics, popular culture, and consumption on the other.

The writing assignments will require analysis and evaluation of our authors\x92 strategies of argumentation. More generally, the course will consider how law itself changes, and how law has mattered\x96- or not\x96- in social and political change. Many questions addressed should ring familiar, from reading that students have done in the notes and other supplementary materials found in standard casebooks that seek to give historical perspectives on doctrinal change. But in this course, without any need to \x93cover doctrine,\x94 there is an opportunity to pursue historical perspectives at length, and wherever the students\x92 interests lead.

We will attend to both historically significant genres, such as the folktale and myth, and genres that are currently thriving, such as the urban legend, the personal narrative, and jokes. Also we will note that some narrative forms are often closely tied in the literature to specific culture groups\x97for example, myths with Native American groups, rap-like \x93toasts\x94 with African American performers, and the Jack tales with Ozark or Appalachian storytellers. Because the topic of American folk narrative is richly inclusive, the course will be to some extent a survey, leaving deeper explorations of each genre or culture group for subsequent coursework or independent research. Consequently, one major requirement for the course will be a research proposal outlining a project that, when completed, would explore a significant question tied to one of the genres surveyed in the course. Additional requirements will include oral reports on research articles, some discussion leadership, and at least one brief piece of fieldwork."

Instructor: Karen Bowdre E-Mail: kmbowdre@indiana.edu Office: Mottier Hall 208 Phone: 855-0530 Since his debut film She\x92s Gotta Have It (1986), Spike Lee has been considered one of the leading figures in Black independent cinema. Though Lee and his films are often deemed controversial, he has established an extensive and diverse body of work in the past twenty years. Lee\x92s oeuvre includes feature films, documentaries, concert films, television programs, commercials, and music videos. In this seminar, we will examine the debates surrounding auteur theory, briefly review the history of Black independent cinema, and consider the processes involved in the production of visual media that complicate the notion of authorship. We will analyze Lee\x92s work through the following lenses: issues of authorship and genre, his position within Black independent cinema, his persona and its relationship to the promotion of his films and the topics his films address. In our analysis of Lee\x92s media, we will probe the subjects of race, class, gender, sexuality, and representation."

In this seminar we will attempt to come to theoretical, interpretative, and critical grips with the under-studied and still largely unexamined corpus of American comic art, its producers, its consumers, and its cultural functions, beginning in the 18th century and continuing through at least the first half of the twentieth, and comprising all media, from painting to political caricature, cartoons, popular prints, trade cards, posters, advertising, illustration, comics, photography, and assorted ephemera. We will attempt to define and analyze the mechanisms of irony, satire, parody, slapstick, whimsy, and wit, explore the realms of cuteness and the grotesque, and survey the borderlines where humor shades into disgust and fear.

Jointly offered with ANTH-E678 and FOLK-F755 If we take ritual to be the social act basic to humanity, as Rappaport argues, this formal event and the multiple related ritual genres (festival, carnival, drama, contests, pilgrimage, etc.), provide an arena for the exploration of the social response to contradiction. Rituals intensify and condense communication, creating an experimental technology, in the words of the Comaroffs, to affect the flow of power in the universe, to plumb the magicalities of modernity. The course will focus on the larger concept of ritual genres as performed in various locations. Using anthropological theories of ritual and power, the course will consider the production of ritual, the form itself, its discourse, and the actual performance. Selected studies will concentrate on the public context of ritual and festival, participation of specific populations, and the outcomes, planned and unplanned. Linking ritual to public culture, the course explores it as a response to contradiction in social and political life. We will consider the interaction of the ritual genres with politics, tourism, history, identity, gender, the state, religion. Examples will include rites of passage (traditional ones and newly created ones), historical celebrations enacting an event in history, occupational festivals, rituals of domination and rituals of resistance. Two papers will be required: one 10 page paper and one 20 page paper. Readings will be announced. (stoeltje@indiana.edu)"

    :subject: ANTH
    :credit: "0"
    :description: "This course will introduce you to the study of human evolution \x96 Paleoanthropology -- a branch of anthropology which seeks to understand human uniqueness by studying the human past using scientific methods. The story of our past can be found in clues from a wide range of sources -- everything from details of DNA to evocative murals in Ice Age caves. This is why the scientific quest for human origins requires the curiosity of a philosopher coupled with the skills of a skeptical detective. We will begin with an introduction to evolutionary principles, and a discussion of the nature of scientific reasoning. While people often think of themselves as very different from other animals, you will discover that we can learn a lot about ourselves by studying the genes, bodies and behavior of our closest living relatives, other primates, and apply this knowledge to help interpret ancient evidence. The present is a key to the past! During the second half of the class we will dig into the past, to look at fossils and archaeological sites for the evidence revealing when and where humans first began to behave like \"odd animals.\" When did our ancestors begin to walk upright? Where were tools and art invented? What do we know about the origins of language and the development of the wide range of social and cultural practices that we consider so \"human\" today? Throughout the semester we will examine examples of how researchers think about \"evidence\" and how scientific theories about human evolution have been built, piece by piece, from a variety of sources. We will look at examples of contrasting interpretations of scientific evidence for the human past, and study why some arguments have stood the tests of time, and are more convincing than others. Our goal is to help you appreciate how a knowledge of the human past is relevant to your own life, whether as a student at IU today, or as a future parent, medical patient, consumer, or IT professional. Class Organization Lectures will introduce students to the major questions we ask about human evolution, and the various methods scientists can use to search for answers. Lectures will complement the assigned readings and online study materials, but not duplicate them. We will also spend time during class periods discussing how to think critically about interesting questions that relate to our evolutionary heritage, and periodically we will do small, in-class exercises and surveys using CLICKERS for participation credit. Weekly Discussion Sections will give you the opportunity to get to know other students in the class, analyze videos and discuss class concepts in a small group, and get \"hands on\" experience studying important fossils, artifacts, and other types of evidence. Sections are a required part of the course. Grades will be based both on participation scores, and on scores for your exams and several take-home assignments that ask you to apply what you have learned in class to real evolutionary problems."

This introductory course will examine how religion helps unify and fuel national movements in this region and underpins government policy in these emerging countries. Academic articles, book chapters, examples in mass media, ethnographic documentaries, and other video footage will illustrate specific instances of where religion and nationalism intersect. In doing so, we will engage and challenge ideas about what nationalism is, how and why nations are built and by whom, and where religion fits within the scope of national interests. Students will develop tools for understanding nationalism, religion, and how they frequently work together. Also, students will demonstrate their growing knowledge in class discussions, quizzes, and final projects. Although helpful, students do not have to have prior experience with the area of the world in question or with the subjects of religion or nationalism. For those who will enroll, however, please be prepared to read, watch, dialogue, and most of all challenge your own assumptions about the world."

This course is divided into two major sections. The first, \x93Far From Broadway: finding performance off-stage\x94, explores the rich world of performance in everyday life. In this section, we will ask the following questions: \x93How do we differentiate between everyday life and performances\x94, \x93How are real social issues addressed in traditional performance genres\x94 and \x93What is the role of rehearsals and workshops in understanding performance?\x94 The second section, \x93All the World\x92s a Stage\x94, will address how genres and performers are changed by globalization. Topics covered in this section include changing gender roles, issues of authenticity and performances created for tourists. Students will be expected to complete a number of ethnographic assignments related to performance. Basic anthropological techniques such as participant-observation and interviewing will be covered throughout the semester. Students will apply these skills to a research topic of their choice. While the majority of the class will be discussion based, there will be several opportunities for field excursions and guest performers. This course will be useful for anyone with an interest in developing a deeper understanding of performance and the performing arts. It will also be useful for anyone wishing to experience anthropological research firsthand. Student evaluations will be based on participation, three ethnographic assignments, midterm exam and final paper. No prerequisites are required."

You will read material that examines how undergraduates learn, along with results of some studies of college teaching. The second is to provide practical information about what to expect as an AI, and what to expect as a future professor of anthropology. There will be some teaching tips, workshops and applications dealing with testing, grading, assessment, and other topics. We will monitor how the classes you are working with are proceeding throughout the semester, and provide information regarding problem solving and course development. We will also draw on the experience and expertise of individuals in other facets of the university, such as the Campus Writing Program, who will offer workshops and discussions with our group. Near the end of the semester we will move toward broader discussions of anthropology programs, how they are framed, and what they need. This should get you thinking about how to construct courses from scratch, and how to develop new course ideas. Each week there will be time for problem-solving and discussion based on what you may be doing at any particular moment in your class, followed by directed topical discussions. You will be asked to sit in on and observe classes in areas other than your subfield. Depending on what courses you are involved in, there will be peer observations. Later in the course you will develop microteachings (short lessons on a specific topic), and teach the rest of us. As a final project, there will be course development, in which you will create course outlines, pick readings and devise assessment techniques for a course of your own. Response papers, a textbook review, and a lecture evaluation will also be included among the assignments. Readings: Curzan, Anne and Lisa Damour. 2000.

B200 carries NMNS credit toward the COAS distribution requirements. You will NOT be able to count this course toward the S & H requirement. We recommend B301, a three credit lab course that also carries NMNS credit, concurrent with or following B200 for anyone who plans a career in anthropology. In B200 we will survey the field of bioanthropology, emphasizing the ways in which ideas about human evolution are tested using evidence from the fossil record, from living prosimians, monkeys and apes, and from contemporary human groups. There will be an emphasis on understanding the underlying principles and science of evolution. Grades are based on four objective exams (each worth 15% of the final grade), as well as several short essays, laboratories and other hands-on activities, making up the remainder of your grade (a total of 40%). Exams and essay questions will be based on lectures, videos, assignments from your textbook, and on short, article-length readings. Our objective in the essay assignments is to build skills in reading and assessing scientific articles. Labs will emphasize analysis of fossils and bones, analysis of research videotape taken by primatologists observing wild chimpanzees, and observations of physical and biochemical features of living humans. THERE WILL BE NO MAKE-UP LABS. Exams are multiple choice. The exams are NOT cumulative, and all four are similar in length and structure. Make-up exams are short-answer/essay in format. Your fourth exam is on the day listed in the schedule of classes as the final for this class, and you must plan your travel around the exam schedule. Please contact me before ANY exam you must miss.

    :description: Humans are unique animals, but 20 million years ago our ape ancestors were hardly distinguishable from any of the more than a dozen apes living then. B464, Human Paleontology, aims to survey the fossil record beginning with the human ancestors that survived the great ape die-off around 10 million years ago to the present. The class will examine the course of human evolution and the evidence paleontologists bring to bear on the issues of morphology, species numbers and selective pressures that affected our lineage. We will begin historically, by examining how scientists came to recognize fossils as extinct animals, and how they learned interpret them. Students will learn basic functional anatomy, and how the study of anatomy and its function helps us to understand extinct animals. We will investigate how the human body functions by treating it as a mechanical solution to life-problems. We will also study evolutionary theory, and what it can tell us about why humans evolved and why we're still evolving. In the course of learning the anatomy and chronology of critical fossils, students will learn why humans became bipedal, why we shifted from a principally vegetarian diet to one that includes animals, why we came to have large brains, and what the impact of tools and other technology has had on our bodies.

Students who complete B524 will feel competent drawing on deep-time paleoanthropological data for work in their own subdiscipline, and will be prepared to teach an undergraduate lecture class in human paleontology. We will direct most of our attention to relatively timeless themes that impact on human paleontology, such as hypothesis testing, evolutionary theory, niche theory, interspecific competition, morphology of fossils, functional anatomy, and behavioral reconstruction, but some trendy topics will be included. Methods of morphological and phylogenetic analysis such as morphometrics and cladistics will be discussed.

What does it mean for our lives? This course addresses these questions by exploring human-environment relationships from cross-cultural, historical, scientific and ethical perspectives. Through readings and discussion, students will evaluate how societies vary in beliefs and perceptions of nature, and the implications for behavior, decision-making, and environmental change. We will examine current environmental problems and the debates over their causes and possible solutions. Using the concepts of ecological footprint, adaptive capacity, and resilience, we will assess the ramifications of our own choices and behaviors. Do we have moral and ethical responsibilities in our patterns of consumption? Students will be evaluated on writing exercises, reading responses, class participation, a midterm and a final exam.

    :description: "The main goal of this course is to introduce the field of Socio-Cultural Anthropology. Socio-cultural Anthropology seeks to study the diversity of human societies in time and space, while looking for commonalities across them. Different from other social sciences Anthropology does not look at a single aspect of human life, but the complexity of human experiences around the world, including our own. We will study the concept of culture and its intersections with our economic and political systems, as well as our social identity and behavior as individuals living within complex societies. Anthropology offers approaches to study the interactions between individuals and communities, and between communities and wider societies, in other words it seeks to understand the building blocks of society. By looking at human societies in a holistic manner, Anthropology offers a series of tools for applied contemporary problems. There are numerous ways to introduce Socio-cultural Anthropology. The course is organized to provide an introduction to main concepts and methods of the field while addressing contemporary issues, relevant in the US and abroad. One of the goals of this course is to provide you with an understanding of anthropology beyond the stereotype of a discipline that deals with the \x93exotic\x94 or the \x93Indiana Jones\x94 type of scholar. Anthropology values linking local and global, past and present understanding of human societies. We hope to present you a rich discipline engaged and contributing to issues of significance in diverse human societies."

As social beings, all peoples have to confront and resolve similar challenges: material survival and well-being; balancing the needs and desires of individuals with those of society; establishing relationships; resolving conflict; finding a satisfying identity; explaining one's place in the world, and expressing themselves in arts and performance. We will examine different cultures to see the ways in which they have dealt with these and other issues. We will also look at the ways in which people and communities situate themselves in the larger global community. Secondly, we will examine how social and cultural anthropologists understand people and their lives and tell their stories. As anthropologists, we spend extended periods of time with those peoples whose lives we hope to understand, at a minimum one year and for many, a lifetime. The results of such empirical field research are ethnographic texts that tell the stories of people's lives. Such ethnographies provide the reading for this course, and will include cultures and societies such as the Cibecue Apache, the!Kung of Southern Africa, Mayan farmers in Guatemala, Hmong refugees living in California, and others. As we read about and work through the different topics, two kinds of questions will guide our understanding: the first examines the external and internal forces that shape cultures and individuals; the second examines the processes by which anthropologists understand the cultures in which they work. Course requirements will include mini field projects that will give you an opportunity to do ethnographic research, a midterm examination composed of short essays, and a final take-home exam."

And how have debates about human difference and sameness developed over the last century or more. In this course we seek to address these broad questions and in doing so orient ourselves to the way in which the field of anthropology has played a crucial role in posing and attempting to answer such questions from multiple different perspectives including: on the basis of human biology, linguistic analysis, archeaological findings, and in-depth ethnographic study of human societies. To focus our discussion we will concentrate on four primary categories of anthropological analysis: race, culture, gender, and language. Each one of these categories - at different historical moments and in varying geographic contexts \x96 plays a key role in how we currently understand human differences and human sameness. Throughout the course we will attempt to gain insight into how such categories explain what it means to be human, how humans themselves have appropriated such categories to describe themselves, how such categories have been historically misused to describe and even dominate others, and what such categories tell us about today\x92s era. We will do so with close attention to the way the definitions of these categories have themselves changed over time and take on different meanings in different contexts."

Before the Spanish came to the New World, the territory of Mexico was home to three of the world\x92s great civilizations--the Maya, the Aztec, and the Zapotec and over a hundred other indigenous groups. Pre-Hispanic Mexico had large cities, trade networks that connected the entire country, arts, astronomy and mathematics, a complex calendrical system, religions and a priesthood, sophisticated laws, courts and judges. Today, indigenous Mexicans still make up over ten percent of the population. The rest of Mexico\x92s people came from Europe, Asia, and Africa over the last five centuries. Some came as conquerors, others as slaves, and still others as merchants, war refugees, artists, and pensioners. More recently, hundreds of thousands of Mexicans (mostly younger, mostly poorer) have been migrating north across the border, looking for opportunities and advancement in the United States. In this course we will learn about Mexico\x92s people--who they are, what they do, what their dreams are. We will explore the lives of Mexicans living in the second largest city in the world. We will follow the story of the Zapatista rebels in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas as they seek justice and land. The old stories of indigenous belief, art, and survival will teach us about Mexico\x92s indigenous peoples. And individual stories of migration will help us understand better the realities of immigration and its effect on both sides of the U.S.-Mexican border. Stories of ingenuity and imagination, of change and continuity, of family and community, of becoming an active partner in globalization while recognizing ancient roots--these are the paradoxes of contemporary Mexico."

A population of about 13 million scattered in the five continents, concentrated in the dozen largest cities of the world, and 60 years after they have suffered genocide, Jews today are experiencing major political, demographic, cultural, and religious challenges. Students will reflect on these important issues by examining the diverse forms of Jewish cultural expression, community membership, and the multiple experiences of Judaism as a religion. Discussions will investigate the diversity of Jewish cultures, the ritual practices of contemporary Jews, their family structures, their collective memory, and how they have reacted to dramatic demographic changes and to secularization. Students will also carry out a fieldwork project that should give them an opportunity to have a personal experience of Jewish ethnography. Requirements: No exam, but a class diary, a fieldwork project, and class participation are required.

The degree and kind of independence and resources they enjoy has changed radically in specific societies from pre-colonial to contemporary times, while their responsibilities continue to multiply. This course follows the themes of autonomy and control of resources, considering both economic resources, such as land, labor, income and cattle, and social resources, such as education, religion and political power. Critical discussions of these alternatives and changes for women will include their relevance to African and US development policy, to African feminist concerns and to our own personal options. There will be a midterm and a final, both taken home. Graduate students will write a research paper.

Covering major statements by expert panels, critique this agenda and explore how to link questions of local and regional interest within this agenda. Four drafts of a proposal are prepared during the course, and each is critiqued in detail before the next draft is prepared. Fulfillment of all requirements of a funding agency such as NSF are required so that students are prepared in short order to submit their work to an agency. The course is ideal for students beginning their third year and preparing proposals. Second year students who have picked their dissertation topic can also fully benefit from the way the course is structured."

    :description: Meets 1st 9 weeks only Both popular and scientific concern over deforestation is at a historically high level. Yet standard macro-level explanations for deforestation such as population growth, poverty, conversion of forest to agriculture, and the penetration of global markets do not account for much of the variation found in forest condition and forest use at the micro (local) level. This nine week course explores theoretical and methodological approaches for exploring human-environment interactions, especially deforestation. It provides training in data collection methods, including participatory techniques, individual and group interviews, and forest measurement. Students apply their training in field research in a forest community in Southern Indiana. The course specifically exposes students to the International Forestry Resources and Institutions Research Program (IFRI). The program is an interdisciplinary, cross-national effort to explore the factors affecting forest conditions at the local level, especially those that influence a community's relationship to its forest. The methods used are drawn from the social, natural, and physical sciences in order to achieve a comprehensive understanding of local-level processes. Researchers are currently using the IFRI approach in over 100 forests in the Americas, Africa and Asia. This course is designed for graduate students who seek to learn theories and methods relevant for social-environmental research, and particularly the approaches of an active, ongoing research program applicable to the human dimensions of environmental change. Students should be aware that this is an intensive course scheduled for the first nine weeks of the semester. It requires several evenings and weekends of fieldwork during the first half of the course. Grades are based in part upon completion of a case study report, which will require additional time beyond the course's nine weeks.

    :description: "Dance does not exist except as it is realized in the human body. Through its performance and its ability to elicit a kinesthetic response in performer and viewer alike, dance becomes elemental and gendered. Classical performance traditions, popular forms, and communally-embedded dance all address gender and the potential for embodied meanings. Embodied forms of discourse speak through a variety of voices and channels creating meanings that may be ambiguous and contradictory. We will examine form and meaning as we explore the danced body and its dialogic potential across Eastern and Western traditions both classical and popular. Seminar participants may choose any genre or tradition of dance or dance-theatre for their research. Readings for the course will include Judith Halberstam . 2005. In a Queer Place and Time.

    :description: "If we take ritual to be the social act basic to humanity, as Rappaport argues, this formal event and the multiple related ritual genres (festival, carnival, drama, contests, pilgrimage, etc.), provide an arena for the exploration of the social response to contradiction . Rituals intensify and condense communication, creating an experimental technology, in the words of the Comaroffs, to affect the flow of power in the universe, to plumb the magicalities of modernity. The course will focus on the larger concept of ritual genres as performed in various locations. Using anthropological theories of ritual and power, the course will consider the production of ritual, the form itself, its discourse, and the actual performance. Selected studies will concentrate on the public context of ritual and festival, participation of specific populations, and the outcomes, planned and unplanned. Linking ritual to public culture, the course explores it as a response to contradiction in social and political life. We will consider the interaction of the ritual genres with politics, tourism, history, identity, gender, the state, religion. Examples will include rites of passage (traditional ones and newly created ones), historical celebrations enacting an event in history, occupational festivals, rituals of domination and rituals of resistance. Two papers will be required: one 10 page paper and one 20 page paper. Readings will be announced. (stoeltje@indiana.edu)"

Such communicative practices run the gamut from ritual invocations of ancestral spirits to story telling, to idle gossip. Ethnographers of communication also examine the complexities of communication between anthropologists and the people that they study. One of our goals for this course is to learn about and critically assess various theoretical frameworks for comparing various types of communicative events, how they are structured and how they operate. A second goal is to learn the methods for doing this kind of ethnography and to gain experience in their application through a series of field work exercises. L500 or equivalent course work is recommended but not required.

    :description: This course is an introduction to the methods and theories of archaeology. Archaeology is the study of human societies based on material remains left behind by people. We will explore the questions that archaeologists ask about past human societies, and the different ways that archaeologists interpret social organization, subsistence, environment, architecture, trade, economic systems, interpersonal relations and political life based on archaeological data. You will learn about the development of scientific archaeology and the goals of archaeology as a subdiscipline within anthropology. Archaeologists employ a wide range of techniques to collect and analyze material remains, including settlement survey, excavation, environmental reconstruction, laboratory analysis of artifacts, dating techniques, and microscale analytical methods borrowed from the physical sciences. Throughout the semester, we will draw on examples of archaeological research from across the globe and will discuss major issues in world prehistory. Examples include the transition to sedentary lifestyles, the development of cities and monumental architecture, and interpretations of everyday social life, identity, and community membership. We will also discuss contemporary issues related to archaeology, such as museums, site preservation, looting, and use of the archaeological past in nation building and ethnic politics. Students should come away from this class with a solid background in how archaeologists do their work, what we have learned from archaeological research about ancient human societies, and how archaeology can be applied to the contemporary world. Students will be evaluated based on attendance at lecture and participation in discussion sections, section assignments, and two exams.

This is a course for students who are drawn to films about archaeologists or Egyptian mummies, but who question the interpretations of ancient people and of archaeologists that the movies present. We will look at how archaeologists are depicted (usually as glamorous adventurers) and compare this with the work that archaeologists actually do. We will address modern issues such as looting, exploitation, and antiquities trade, and see how artifacts can have lives of their own. One theme that recurs in such films is the romance of discovery as archaeologists retrieve ancient materials from archaeological sites. Where does this impression derive from, and how does it compare to the actual activities of real (not reel) archaeologists? Another theme is site devastation, which we will evaluate in all its metaphorical glory. In addition, film producers make movies that cater to our curiosity about so-called forgotten cultures. How realistic are the interpretations that film producers present? We will examine films that depict ancient people and places, including Egypt. Film genres include romantic comedy, drama, sci fi, and even anim\xE9. A series of e-reserve writings by and about archaeologists augment the films and provide a basis for discussion, which we will do both in class and via Oncourse discussion forums.

    :description: "This course is designed to explore archaeological research into the past in North America. For more than 10,000 years in Native North America, hundreds of unique cultural groups flourished, from the shores of the Atlantic to the shores of the Pacific, and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Circle. Regional chronologies are best understood by focusing on the methods and theories that archaeologists use to reconstruct cultural lifeways and to assess culture change in those areas. This course will address current and relevant issues for the archaeology of North America including the peopling of the New World, hunter-gatherer research, origins of agriculture, origins of sociopolitical complexity and inequality, trade and exchange, post-colonial culture contact and multi-ethnic communities, and archaeological ethics. The archaeological evidence from several regions will be emphasized, including the Eastern Woodlands, the Midcontinent, the Plains, the Southwest, and the West Coast. Within each topic, we will explore basic foundations; consider multiple interpretations, debates, and controversies; and evaluate case studies. This class is not meant to provide students with a \x93laundry list\x94 of names, places, and dates. We will spend some time learning about the people, material culture, and geography of North America. We will then build on that knowledge to address specific questions relating to long-term research about the past and discuss ways that these questions are relevant for us today in the present. What you will gain is an appreciation for the diversity of ideas and opinions about the archaeological record, as well as the people who created it. You will learn about the major controversies and debates surrounding this research. And you will have the opportunity to critically evaluate the evidence for yourselves. The course grade will be based on a midterm and final exam, geography quizzes, discussion, and short written assessments. Prerequisites: Students are strongly encouraged to have completed ANTH P200 (Introduction to Archaeology) or similar course.

What is the significance of potatoes, coca, guinea pigs, and llamas? Why did empires flourish in the Andes at different times in the past? Who built the Nazca lines and what do they mean? Where did the Inca come from, what happened to them, and why did they place children on some of the highest mountaintops? We will approach these topics and other questions for one of the most complex and fascinating areas of the world in terms of archaeological research--the Andes mountains of South America. You will see how environment and natural resources provide a backdrop for the development of transportation, domestication and intensive agriculture, technological change, social and ethnic differentiation, and religious systems that focus on high places, and the sun. What effect has archaeology had in Peru? Archaeological tourism is a booming industry, looting is rampant, and cultural, national and ethnic identities are often construed on the basis of archaeological knowledge and findings. We will address these issues as well, because archaeology, though it deals with the past, is something that happens in the here and now. The course will combine illustrated lectures, films, discussions and group exercises to explore the Andean region-from its foundations in fishing villages, to its complex cultures of Moche, Chan Chan, Wari, Tiwanaku and Inca. The course will be organized thematically, with topics including environment, subsistence and agriculture, interaction, social structure, technology, empires, religion, and the effect of archaeology. In the context of these topics, specific cultures will be studied. Course evaluation will consist of tests (with both objective and subjective questions), and a final creative project.

One of the goals of PR is the democratization of knowledge (re)production, with the knowledge and products gained from PR research directed to improving community well being. Through readings, speakers and practice with examples from a range of PR projects in various disciplines, this course will provide grounding in the theory and practice of PR methods, examining how PR principles transform the process and outcomes of social science research. We will also explore contemporary themes related to ethics, decolonizing research and the complex power relations of the researcher. The emphasis in this seminar will be on applications of PR to anthropology, archaeology, and heritage management; however other topics and disciplines (i.e. folklore, education, public health, sociology, etc.) can be addressed to fit the needs of those enrolled in the course. Format: In-class discussion of weekly readings."

The purpose of this course is to analyze the nature of crime and the processes of justice in the United States, to examine the historical and constitutional foundations of the American system of justice, and to consider its strengths as well as its weaknesses. As such, the course considers the definition of crime and law, the nature and extent of crime, the constitutional foundations of law and justice, and the agents of the law (i.e., examination of policing, the court system, and agents of punishment, the correctional system). In that regard, themes such as the due process and crime control models of criminal justice, the construction of crime, law, and justice, the impact that drug abuse and the \"war on drugs\" have on crime and criminal justice processing, the role of race, class, and gender in criminal justice as cross-cultural perspectives in the administration of justice, and public policies with respect crime control and punishment.

More specifically, the objectives of this course are: 1. To show how the definition of what is a crime changes over time and how other (more harmful) acts other than traditional street crimes have not traditionally been defined as criminal. 2. To introduce you to how scientific inquiry is conducted on criminal behavior or the behavior of criminal justice actors through the usage of theories as explanations. 3. To increase your understanding about the key distinction between \"law on the books\" (in the form of official rules or laws) and law in action (in terms of the actual behavior of criminal justice actors) within the criminal justice system). 4. To introduce you to the structure and process of the criminal justice system. 5. To expose you to the prevalence and implications of discretionary decisionmaking in the criminal justice system.

    :description: "This course focuses on the administration of criminal justice. We will explore the decision-making process whereby some citizens become suspects, some suspects become defendants, some defendants are convicted and in turn become probationers, inmates, and parolees. This will be accomplished by examining the operational practices at the major criminal justice decision-making stages (i.e., police, courts and corrections). Contemporary problems and issues in criminal justice administration will be highlighted and contrasted with the unique history of American criminal justice. This is a required course for all criminal justice majors, and also fulfills distribution requirements for other schools in the College of Arts & Sciences. The course will be divided into four roughly equal parts. Part One will focus on some basic history and definitions of terms, as well as an examination of the definition of crime. Part Two will focus primarily on the apprehension of persons suspected of committing crime, with a heavy emphasis on the role of the police. Part Three will examine the workings of the courts and the actors (such as prosecutors, judges, and defense attorneys) who work in the judicial system. We will also discuss sentencing issues and the death penalty. Part Four will explore the correctional system by examining some punishment rationales, prisons and their history, and community corrections. Readings: To be announced Requirements: There will be four examinations (and a few pop quizzes) in this course, corresponding to the four parts discussed. Exams & quizzes will be primarily objective in nature (mostly multiple choice with some true/false). The exam questions will be taken from the textbook and from class lectures.

    :description: "Few subjects capture attention and arouse curiosity more than crime. Movie themes revolve around it, the media feeds upon it, and politicians declare war on it. While crime trends have remained relatively stable over the past twenty years, certain forms of crime, involving certain subgroups, have fluctuated significantly in recent times. The goal of this course is to better understand crime trends and the nature and causes of criminal activity. The focus of this course is on the offender, and the factors, circumstances or conditions that influence involvement in law violating behavior. We begin with a discussion of what we mean by crime and social control. We then move on to talk about the nature and extent of crime, paying particularly close attention to the way we measure crime and the impact that measurement problems have on our systems of social control. (For example, most of our measures of crime do not include white collar crimes, yet these offenses involve greater financial and physical harms that do many so-called common crimes). We will then examine the major theories that attempt to explain criminal behavior. We will begin with constitutional theories, which suggest that criminal behavior is the product of the biological and psychological constitution of the individual. This will be followed by sociological theories -- those that account for criminal behavior by examining the social environment of both individuals and groups. In the process,we will look at such factors as the community, the family, peers, schools, economic structures, etc., to better understand the role they play in shaping conduct norms. Finally, we will examine the role of opportunity structures for crime that facilitate or impede law breaking behavior. Readings: To be announced.

    :description: "Overview: If you are enrolled in P411, it is most likely that someday you will be working professionally in the criminal justice system or a related agency. Whether you find yourself in an entry-, middle-, or upper-level position, your own vision of justice will be transformed by the daily life of your new organization. Whether working in law enforcement, court systems, prisons, probation, parole, victim advocacy, dispute settlement, juvenile justice, etc., you will face obstacles and issues that all professionals encounter. You will have to know something about how to organize and work with large groups of people, about how to meet goals and objectives with limited resources, about how to manage conflicts and resolve disputes, and about how to be a good leader and achieve job satisfaction. But as criminal justice actors, you will also face a number of unique circumstances unlike any other profession. You will be in the position of making (in some cases, split-second) decisions about people\x92s lives, careers, families, and futures. You will often face non-voluntary, if not, hostile clients, frustrated co-workers, and a stressful workplace. However, you will have the opportunity to work in a field where you will always make a difference. In this course, we will build a foundation to help you understand the kinds of issues criminal justice actors face on the job and outline strategies to better address those concerns. We will do this by working through the nature of management in bureaucratic organizations and institutions, specifically in the context of criminal justice. Our project will be guided by organizational sociology, research on workplace environments, lessons from the private sector, studies of police, courts, and corrections, and, perhaps most importantly of all, practical experience. As a class, we will seek to develop a well-informed, critical foundation from which to envision and practice better justice. This course is also designated as an \x93intensive writing\x94 experience by the university, which means that a good deal of your graded efforts in the course will involve developing your writing skills and expressing your thoughts and experiences on paper. Service Learning Component: P411 is designed to fulfill service learning credit. Service learning is \x93a type of experiential education in which students participate in service in the community and reflect on their involvement in such a way as to gain further understanding of course content and of the discipline and its relationship to social needs and an enhanced sense of civic responsibility\x94 (Hatcher and Bringle, 1997: 153). In P411, each student will visit with an assigned youth at the Bloomington Juvenile Correctional Facility (BJCF) for one to two hours a week and while there, work closely with the youth, helping him meet treatment goals and plan for re-entry into the community. You will be provided mandatory training for this activity during an orientation session at BJCF. You must also undergo a complete background check. Students will need to provide their own transportation or carpool with classmates. We will spend a portion of each class discussing your visits and relating your experience to course materials and the topic of management. You will be assessing the nature of correctional treatment at BJCF by exploring the ways in which treatment programs are being successfully (or unsuccessfully) implemented. You will conclude the semester by making evaluations/recommendations to BJCF concerning their administration. This service learning component will most likely be the most challenging and rewarding aspect of the course. If you feel that the service learning component will be difficult for you to fit into your busy schedule, you are strongly encouraged to enroll in another criminal justice course. Although an alternative curriculum can be devised in place of service learning for exceptional cases, you will be isolated from most discussion and classroom engagement in the course.

The first part of the course is a general introduction to institutional, scientific, and symbolic dimensions of the epidemic. The second and third parts shifts into ethnographic research and intervention focusing on illegal behaviors and HIV transmission risks associated with sex and drug use.

    :description: "INTRODUCTION There is certainly no escaping the relationship between the question of race and crime. In addressing the issue, it is almost impossible to talk honestly about the interaction of the two without offending or even angering both majority and minority group members. The truth is much too terrible. Race and racism continue to shape American life. This course addresses a number of issues: (1) emphasizes the contemporary realities associated with race and crime from the standpoint of the historical interconnections of the social, political and economic processes that shape the life chances of African Americans; (2) discusses the definitional problems associated with the concepts of race and crime; (3) addresses some of the explanatory issues related to minority crime causation; (4) policy implications associated with the interaction of race and criminality. EXPECTATIONS Individuals who may perceive the materials or the topics incongruous with their values, their assessment of the real world, or who are unable to accept different explanations and/or viewpoints should also reconsider their options. All students are expected to do the required readings, attend class regularly, take careful notes, and submit assignments on time.

    :description: "Course Description Juveniles are accorded special status under the American legal system. Children and adolescents also account for a disproportionate amount of crime committed. Preventing such behavior and responding to its occurrence are matters of concern to society at large and to the criminal justice system in particular. This seminar is designed to examine psychological, sociological, and developmental theories that tackle the question: \x93What causes juveniles to break the law?\x94 We will critically analyze the impact of significant individual, social, and institutional influences on youth behavior. This seminar will also focus on the structure and impact of the traditional juvenile justice system as well as alternative approaches to intervention and treatment. Course Objectives: The goals of this course are for students to: 1) Learn about the nature and extent of juvenile delinquency in the United States; 2) Become familiar with and critically evaluate the major theories that have been developed as explanations for the onset of, continuation in and desistance from delinquency; 3) Understand the role of external factors such as family, peer groups, education, and poverty on child development and delinquency; 4) Learn about society's response to delinquency through informal and formal mechanisms of control; and 5) Apply knowledge about the causes and correlates of delinquency to a critical assessment of juvenile justice policy and existing intervention, prevention, and treatment strategies. The above objectives are to be achieved through a process involving readings, lectures, class discussions and independent research. Required Readings Howell, J.C. (2003).

We also question the role of killing in the construction of our relationships with each other-in building our own identities and those of others as well as in constructing our communities and interpersonal relationships. A goal of this course is to familiarize you with various ways in which those who study homicide try to explain it (and suggest how it can be controlled). I hope to encourage your thinking about these approaches and the development of your criticisms. I also favor materials that retain the lives of the people and bring to life the situations that are part of homicidal relationships. The readings consider a range of factors that are part of homicidal relationships, including frameworks that emphasize the interaction between biology and society, the roles of history in contemporary relationships, social reciprocity and interdependency, prejudice, the use in culture of killings and killers to organize relationships to the world, and politics (among other aspects of our participation in society and culture). Our stance in relationship to analytic frameworks for explaining homicide is that understanding killing in our own societies and elsewhere is very much work in progress-that this course is part of that process through questioning how we interpret homicide and through relating it to our lives.

    :description: "When a police officer uses deadly force, when a prosecutor offers a reduced plea, when an immigration official detains an asylum seeker, or when a housing board gives a tenant an extension to pay back rent, discretion is exercised. We know that discretion is ubiquitous in criminal justice, yet what do we know of its nature and exercise? What is the place of individual judgment within a structure of rules? How do people reach decisions in criminal justice settings, and how are their choices affected by social, economic, and political factors? When is discretion discrimination? How can discretion be limited or guided in desirable directions? This course will examine the nature of discretion, where and why it arises, and what influences its exercise. By the end of the semester, students should be able to analyze the sources of discretion and the influences on it across a variety of criminal justice settings. Students also should be able to describe alternative approaches to improving the exercise of discretion and to use current research to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of theses approaches.

The course will teach about criminal behavior and victimization from the theoretical perspectives of Environmental Criminology, Routine Activities Approach and movement patterns in everyday life. The course will present the literature pertaining to the research of Cohen, Felson, Clarke, Brantinghams, Rengert, Harries, LeBeau, Langworthy and many other pioneers of this field. The theory will be firmly grounded within the discourse of Crime Prevention on the basis of Rational Choice perspective. The laboratory portion will focus upon the development of skills in preparing crime maps, displaying related social, economic, political, demographic and physical features and analyzing patterns in crime. Students will learn about the structure of different data sets such as crime data from police departments, Census data and important physical locations, buildings, malls and schools from municipal and other agencies. They will learn about Geo-coding and bringing all such data within an inter-related Geographical Information System. Thereafter, they will be taught to apply the theoretical perspectives in analyzing such Geo-coded data to understand how crime is affected by land use patterns, residential layouts, street networks, transportation systems and different regular activities of a place. They will be taught ways to determine the hot spots of different crime types and ways of analyzing crime patterns using the concepts of geographical profiling.

We will train our use of semiotic tools to understand how scholars, social agents and citizens come to construct, use, be imprisoned by, and resist conventional concepts of crime and justice. Three ethnographies which focus on crime as a key element will provide the textual field for these explorations.

Through our discussion of these texts, we will become familiar with specific techniques of creative writing available to the poet and fiction writer.

How has a medium that began as a cult phenomenon cultivated a substantial fan culture, and what is this fandom's nature? How are fan communities defining the future direction of anime in America? And, for an art form often defined by its stylization of Japanese ideas and attitudes, why has it become so popular here? In order to understand the place of anime in American culture, we'll examine the history of anime as it's been brought to America, with an eye to grasping the historical context and ideological content of the medium's diverse representations. We will also work complexly with a wide range of material artifacts of anime fan culture, even visiting and studying an anime convention.

    :description: This course focuses on the ways in which the philological (linguistic and textual) interests of J. R. R. Tolkien are virtually omnipresent in The Lord of the Rings and largely make that work what it is. The course considers not only the several invented languages used in the book, but also its relative avoidance of words not descended from Old English or other Germanic languages. Additionally, Tolkien's exploitation of fine sociolinguistic distinctions (between social classes and ethnic groups) receives well- deserved study. Becoming acquainted with one man's indulgence for inventing languages, and with his passion for studying real language no longer spoken, can lead to a greater understanding of the principles which underlie the structure and functioning of all languages, ancient as well as modern.

The focus of this course is on practice where you will experiment with structure as it relates to concept through both traditional and experimental bindings. We will be cognizant of how structure, materials, layout and design, and use of text convey and emphasize your ideas so that craft and content are fully integrated in the books you make. We will also explore the evolution of artists' books from the earliest forms, such as the livre d'artiste, through the explosion in creativity and concept that occurred in the 1960's and beyond. Through readings and visits to the collections of the Lilly and Fine Arts Libraries, you will be exposed to a vast array of possibilities for this medium. The course will culminate with an exhibition of student books at the Fine Arts Library Foyer during finals week.

The course takes a cross-cultural approach and looks at material ranging from North Africa to 17th-century Quakers to a modern-day Deaf Church to high school and college students in San Francisco, Virginia and the Midwest, all of which can be found in the new Cultural Approach to Interpersonal Communication edited by Leila Monaghan and Jane Goodman. One strong focus of the class is examining language used every day by Indiana students\x97gendered language, slang, cursing and verbal play. Past students have told us that this course changed the way they view the world and that they now see patterns in their conversations and lives that they had never even considered before. Interpersonal Communication classes are a lively mixture of lecture and discussion. Students are asked to connect rigorous theoretical readings to their own lives\x97how they interact with friends, family, lovers and disliked acquaintances. In addition to the ethnographic research project where students tape and analyze the interpersonal communication of a social group of their choice, students will be expected to make low-key presentations of the material they read. Students in this class develop a unique set of analytical skills, making them more confident in reading and speaking about complex material and in understanding how communication impacts their own lives. It is also an unusual opportunity to do original primary research at the undergraduate level and makes an excellent foundation for any further work in performance and ethnography in departments such as Communication and Culture, Anthropology and Sociology."

But what are \x93the media?\x94 How do they work and for whom? As media increasingly pervade the fabric of daily life, and as fewer and fewer entities dominate media ownership, the urgency of asking and answering these questions only grows in importance. Yet, these questions are incredibly difficult to ask\x97much less to answer\x97owing in part to the ways in which the structure and functioning of the media remain, for many of us, taken for granted, perhaps even something of a mystery. This course will introduce you to the basic vocabularies of visual and media literacy and hone your skills at analyzing media texts, institutions, apparatuses, and audiences critically. We will focus on four prevalent media genres\x97 film, radio, television, and the internet\x97and our goal will be to explore the relationships between and among form, content, ownership, and meaning with respect to each. C190 will help you to appreciate more fully the complex ways in which the media inhabit and affect social, cultural, political, and economic life. More importantly, it will provide you with the analytical, interpretive, and critical skills by which to navigate and begin to make sense of the densely mediated landscapes we inhabit. Assessment will be based on attendance and participation, screening notes, two exams, and two writing assignments. Required Reading: Kolker, Robert. Film, Form, and Culture. 3rd ed.

Using history as the primary point of departure, we will examine the cultural, social, and political location of various ethnic \x93minorities,\x94 including Native Americans, Asian Americans, African Americans, and Latinos/as, and their media representations, particularly in film and television. The course is divided into four sections: (1) Foundations; (2) Ethnic Minorities and Mainstream Film; (3) Ethnic Minorities and Mainstream TV; and (4) Ethnic Minorities and their Cultural Spaces. Issues of production, representation, and interpretation will be considered as a way of understanding who controls the production of images and how audiences might interpret them. Course Objectives \x95 Analyze the ways in which U.S. racial discourses and larger political, historical, and social processes have informed the mainstream media representations of ethnic minority groups in particular historical periods. \x95 Consider/evaluate how audience segmentation and the exportation of mainstream television and film products have had an impact on the representation of specific U.S. ethnic groups. \x95 Introduce the students to some of the cultural artifacts produced by ethnic minority groups in order to understand how independently produced media address specific community-based issues regarding ethnicity, culture, and identity. Grading Policy and Class Requirements Grades will be based on your performance on three exams and two written assignments. 200 points total. Exams: There will be three scheduled exams in this course.

Communication does not merely \x93transmit\x94 the beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and identities that define human culture \x97 it actively shapes and defines them. This course critically examines the productive and dialectical relationship between communication and culture, exploring some of the ways that communication crafts culture and that culture affects communication. As an introductory course, C205 offers a broad overview of the conceptual vocabularies and critical strategies that scholars use to study communication. The goal here is to provide students with the ability to recognize and discuss these various perspectives, and thus begin to develop the tools needed to become an intelligent observer of human communication as well as an effective participant in contemporary culture. This course also is an introduction to the unique perspective provided by the combined interests and talents of the faculty in the department of Communication & Culture. Toward this end, we will read essays written by scholars whose interests represent those that characterize our faculty, including Rhetoric & Public Culture, Ethnography & Performance, and Film & Media. Our goal is to synthesize from these readings a coherent intellectual attitude. Coursework will include several short quizzes, two midterms, and a final.

Is it the same as \x91visual culture\x92? This course offers an interdisciplinary and historical context for understanding contemporary Western \x91image culture\x92 by addressing the notion of the \x91image\x92 in a wide range of its theoretical, critical and practical contexts, uses and history. Images are objects of study in disciplines from art history to neuroscience, from political science to cultural studies. The ubiquity of visual imagery is only half the story of contemporary image culture, given that there is a whole family of graphic, optical, perceptual and mental imagery. We thus need an appreciation of dreams, fantasies, memories, literary images, metaphors, ideas and sense impressions, as well as corporate, political, personal, bodily and commodity images. By figuring out the family resemblances between the uses of the term \x91images\x92, the significance of images for contemporary culture emerges. The course also examines the claim that our culture is more imagistic than others historically, asking how the roles of images have changed over time in relation to other modes of signification. In discussing a selection of key readings across the domains of philosophy, art, literature, science, critical theory and cultural studies, the course tells the story of the image from the Bible to the present. REQUIRED READING Almost all the reading selections will be drawn from one anthology: Sunil Manghani, Arthur Piper and Jon Simons (eds) Images: A Reader (Sage, 2006).

This first semester course will cover the period from the origins of commercial filmmaking to the middle of the twentieth century. The primary focus will be the development of the Hollywood studio system and the establishment of a classical style of Hollywood filmmaking. Along the way, this course will also look at several key issues: movie exhibition, from nickelodeons to movie palaces, and the studios' strategies for supplying these theaters with movies; the relationship between Hollywood and Wall Street; the organization of the production process; the development of stars, genres, and a \"Hollywood\" film style; the relationship between movies and other media; technological innovations; censorship; changes in movie audiences, etc. We will view feature-length movies and other films produced by the studios in order to understand how American movies came to function as both an art and a business. Students will be expected to attend a weekly evening screening session where we will view movies of the period. Grades will be based on short papers and exams. *The second course is C292 \x96 Hollywood (1950-Present), which will be taught during the Spring semester."

In these narratives, forced contact with an other becomes the basis for defining and questioning the self. The first best-seller in America told the adventurous ordeal of a Colonial woman captured by Native Americans; 300 years later, fabulous stories of UFO abduction arose in popular culture. What can we learn about America by looking at the evolution of captivity narratives over time? How has American identity been shaped and challenged through imagining the capturing other? This class explores a wide range of captivity narratives, from the historical to the fantastic. Along with Indian captivity and UFO abduction, our study will include fiction and non-fiction accounts of containment and redemption, including texts about slavery, prison, Satanic possession, mental hospitals, kidnappings during the Iraqi war, stories of children secluded from society, and the desires for containment and release in the making of nuclear weapons. This class is interdisciplinary in scope. We will use literature, film, anthropology and psychology to study both scholarly and popular understandings of captivity and freedom. Our focus will include the following themes: colonization and the land, the body and technological development, religious questing, and discourses of gender, race and class. Through lecture, students will be introduced to some social theories of containment in culture and language. In addition, we will substantively explore the boundaries between memory and fantasy. Therefore, this class will also introduce students to current theories of traumatized memory and the debates over false and repressed memories in America.

Clothes keep us warm and appropriately attired. Cars transport us to work or to classes. Computers allow us to write papers and conduct research. But at some level we also realize that we live in a world in which the consumer goods that we purchase speak volumes about who we are, what groups we belong to, and what we aspire to become. Do you shop for clothes at Abercrombie & Fitch or at Wal- Mart? Do you actually drive your SUV over rugged terrain or, like most of us, use it simply to get around town? Are you a Windows person or a Mac person? The answers to these questions are meaningful: our choices help us craft a social identity, one that is recognizable -- shared by people \"like us,\" but not by those who are different. The consumption of goods and services plays a crucial role in the American economy, but consumer culture is more than the sum of the things that we own. Whether we're in public or in the privacy of our homes, strolling across campus or watching television, we're enveloped by advertising. It's the world we inhabit today\x97one where it seems normal to be addressed as a potential consumer in virtually every waking moment of our lives, where we happily turn ourselves into living advertisements by wearing clothes that announce the brands that we buy. The goal of this course is to make us more aware of how advertising operates in society and how we live within consumer culture. What are the goals of the advertising industry? What information, ideas, and values are communicated in advertising? What role does advertising play in television, movies, and magazines? How do manufacturers and retailers create \"brand-name\" products, and why do we care about these brands? What do advertisers know about consumers? Are we, as consumers, manipulated by advertising or do we make independent decisions about what to purchase? Is it possible to live in the modern world without adopting the values of consumer culture? Is it possible to resist the constant messages that tell us \"you are what you buy\x94?

J. Fischer, Perilous States This course explores the ways ethnographic work can serve as a way of \x93making strange\x94 the world in which we live. By looking at our world through the lens of other societies and cultures, we begin to notice things about our societies and ourselves that we had always taken for granted. We start to understand the ways in which our own world is structured. We begin to pay attention to the culturally specific nature of our own beliefs and assumptions. The self provides a focal point around which our inquiry will be organized. Embedded in our ideas about personhood are broader cultural assumptions about the relationship between mind and body, between individual and society, between structure and agency. Larger societal discourses and ideologies inform the ways we experience selves and bodies. By critically examining specific self-making practices in a range of ethnographic settings, we develop a more informed, critical perspective on our own society. Course topics will likely include: selfhood in the liberal state; the self as a narrative project; transforming the self; selves, feelings, emotions; embodying selves; transforming selves; fragmenting selves; virtual selves.

Ask Michael Moore and he might mention that Fahrenheit 9/11 grossed $120 million (\x85 and counting, the previous high was $21.6 million). But Fahrenheit 9/11 did not come out of the blue. Its success was the culmination of almost two decades of resurgence, highlighted by Moore\x92s own Roger & Me, Alek Keshishian\x92s Madonna: Truth or Dare and Steve James\x92 Hoop Dreams. Moore may be the face most commonly associated with documentary\x92s growth in popularity, but Errol Morris has perhaps been more influential in shaping contemporary filmmakers\x92 aesthetic and philosophical vision. Moore brought audiences to the theaters and generated enormous and highly polemical political debate. Morris\x92 films convinced many filmmakers that artistic documentaries need not be relegated to film festivals and art theaters alone. This course will examine the feature films and television programs of Michael Moore and Errol Morris as well as the work of some of their contemporaries. We will analyze their work critically and theoretically and situate it within the historical tradition of documentary film. We will consider their respective impacts on the film industry and audience expectations of documentary film. We will explore the differences between their film and television output, examining how each medium effects the construction of the work.

Focusing on social stigma allows us to understand how specific cultural value systems affect our most intimate senses of self, and indeed contribute to our very notions of personhood. Stigma theory speaks broadly to the nature of the social relationships that create marked categories of persons, regardless of the particular attributes devalued. In this class we look both at theory and at particular cases of devaluation, since attention to the particularities of a given stigma keys us in to the complex of cultural values that create it. The theoretical centerpiece of this course is Erving Goffman\x92s 1963 study Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity. We will read this text closely to appreciate Goffman\x92s insights, and attempt throughout the semester to update the language he uses to convey his points by applying his model to more recent historical and ethnographic case studies of stigmatized persons and groups. Our primary focus will be on the range and efficacy of the various strategies available for managing and/or deflating stigma. The role of the expressive arts in the life trajectories of stigmatized persons and groups will be explored as one such strategy. We will focus in particular on artists and activists whose work addresses contemporary cases of stigma involving class, race, ethnicity, disability, gender and sexuality. Bi-weekly screenings of landmark films in the fields of disability studies, black studies, queer studies, and gender studies supplement regular class meetings. Online postings on a class-by-class discussion site facilitate regular and full student participation."

That\x92s because surfaces always communicate. For example, everyone wears clothing and reacts, sometimes quite strongly, to the ways others dress. Most people frequently reflect on the meanings and purposes of dress by reading fashion advice, watching TV programs about style, carefully imitating (usually famous) others, perusing catalogs, shopping for special and everyday occasions, and so on. Consequently, most of us tacitly or openly acknowledge the importance of communicating through our clothes and know how to do so more or less skillfully. Indeed, this is one of our most common and purposive forms of communication\x97a rhetoric of the everyday. Our challenge will be to try to think \x93behind\x94 our \x93how-to\x94 expertise to the rules that govern it, the purposes these rules serve, and the effects\x97direct and indirect, personal and social, political and economic, repressive and expressive, manageable and unruly, etc.\x97they generate.

We will examine how these constructs of subjectivity interrelate to commonly held and frequently unquestioned assumptions about race, class, nationality, and ability. We will think about how our assumptions about gender and sexual norms are shaped through and in turn shape several prominent sites of popular culture: advertising, television, film, music, and \x93cyberculture.\x94 Students will learn to decode the messages and meanings in select examples from each of these sites.

Given these topics, we will grapple with questions about illness, violence, and resistance\x97 including, but not limited to: what is U.S. contemporary public culture\x92s attitude towards death and illness? How do our dispositions vary depending on the cause of death? In what ways does language limit and make possible our ability to communicate about bodies in pain?

How are our definitions and beliefs about illness and violence shifting within the current political context of the \x93War on Terror\x94? Which ethical positions do actions of trauma, hate, and sickness provoke us to imagine, reinvent, and/or abandon? What are the politics of memory?

It examines how communication contributes alternatively to the articulation of cultures of war and peace, giving special attention to the role of language in shaping the meanings of war and peace in contemporary America and throughout the history of peace movements in the U.S. Language practices are located at the center of peace-building as a key resource for critiquing dehumanizing discourses of war and imagining re- humanizing alternatives. Peace-building communication, in this sense, is conceptualized as a creative and constructive practice of language critique, an expression of moral imagination that contributes to positive social change by transcending the cycle of mutual recrimination. The course will examine peace-building communication strategies, tactics, and rituals that encompass the role of media, including creative uses of new media, in the artful dissent from war. It will consider modes of language critique that contest demonizing discourses of war, foster a humanizing language of democratic citizenship and political friendship, transcend the viewpoint of war, and apprehend the competing perspectives of adversaries. It will feature a range of case studies, including peace-building critiques of the war on terrorism. Readings: Final selections for course readings will be made over the summer, but they are likely to include books such as the following: Lisa Schirch, Ritual and Symbol in Peacebuilding (Kumarian Press, 2005), Robert L. Ivie, Dissent from War (Kumarian Press, 2007 in press), John Paul Lederach, The Moral Imagination: The Art and Soul of Building Peace (Oxford University Press, 2005). Class Format and Assignments: The course is designed as an undergraduate research seminar. The emphasis is on discussion of assigned readings and of each student\x92s term research project. Each student will design a research project that builds on the assigned readings of the course applied to a specific peace-building challenge that is of particular interest to that student. Students will discuss their developing plans for their term projects with one another throughout the semester and share the final results of their research at the end of the semester in oral and written reports.

To do so, we will be examining the histories of grassroots environmental, environmental justice, and anti- environmental movements. As a course grounded in a rhetorical perspective, we also will be developing our skills as advocates and critics of issues related to environmental advocacy. Our primary goal is to become more reflexive about how people communicate with, about, and in the environment as rhetorical agents in public culture. Specifically, we will emphasize what have been the constraints\x97both the limitations and the possibilities\x97of persuading U.S. publics about environmental concerns. Our readings reflect the vast range of environmental issues that the course objectives entail, from the creation of national parks to the impacts of environmental racism on toxically-assaulted communities to the success of environmental backlash today in rolling back environmental protections and infrastructure. In doing so, we also will consider a variety of public advocacy practices, including tourism, slide shows, boycotts, civil disobedience, public participation, and media campaigns.

On the other hand, in many countries around the world, although TV was first used as an avenue for education and as a space where national cultures were represented, there have been industrial and textual transformations where the global permeates the \x91local.\x92 Thus, TV (outside the U.S.) has been constructed as a medium that promotes Americanization to the detriment of national cultures or as a location where audiences mediate dominant and alternative ideological discourses. In this course we will explore television as a medium that rearticulates dominant and vernacular cultures and as a technological/cultural/commercial artifact that attracts a variety of local and global audiences. Drawing from various theoretical approaches (i.e., cultural imperialism, indigenization, cultural proximity, and globalization), we will examine television production, texts, and audience reception in order to understand the complexities of one of the most popular media of our time.

Performance as performative, particularly seeing how speech has force. 4. Performance as artful communication, particularly the poetics of performance. 5. Performance as display event rooted in Durkheimian tradition, focuses on ritual practice as the ground of conscience collective. In Documentary Theater, we will examine the intellectual underpinnings of performance and produce ethnographic theatre pieces that reflect and test the power of these notions.

In this course, we will explore the complex relationships between cultural values, power relations, and communicative practices among various populations of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA). Taking an ethnographic perspective, we view performance not only in terms of a formal display for an audience but also as the range of events and practices through which cultural values are negotiated and social relations are organized. In other words, Moroccan marketplace talk, Bedouin women\x92s love poetry, or the listening practices of young male consumers of Algerian rai (world beat) music will be as important to our inquiry as the staged concerts of a national Egyptian star. As we ask what it is that people are up to when they engage in communicative practices, we will also problematize what \x93communicative practice\x94 entails and how it has been variously theorized. In moving from what scholars of performance have called the interaction order (face-to- face communication) to global media, we will necessarily be engaging with a range of theoretical paradigms, drawn from fields including anthropology, performance studies, and cultural studies. Classroom discussions will be critical to being able to understand and contrast these varied perspectives. The focus of the course is on how communicative practice is organized in the societies of the MENA rather than on how these societies are represented by Western media. At the same time, we acknowledge that the authors (mostly Western) whose works we will be reading have their own positionality with regards to the locations of their research, and we will also attend to their representational practices and politics. The course format features structured discussions, minilectures, small group work, and numerous video and audio presentations. Core texts may include: Abu-Lughod, Lila. 1986.

Smith E-Mail: cds@indiana.edu Office: Mottier Hall 212 Phone: 855-5307 This class provides an introduction to the study of the built environment from a rhetorical perspective. The course explores the persuasive dimensions of places and spaces built by human beings. It examines how buildings, theme parks, monuments, housing developments, museums, and shopping malls are the product of strategic communication choices designed to influence how we think and behave. Further, it examines the implications of those choices for human thought and behavior. At the end of this course, you should be able to 1. recognize that architecture is an inherently rhetorical process and that the built environment is the product of human choices, persuasive efforts, socioeconomic forces, and media coverage 2. understand how architecture as rhetoric is similar to and differs from more traditionally-studied forms of rhetoric, such as public speeches 3. identify and understand the elements of a given rhetorical situation to which a particular form of architecture is a response 4. understand the most frequently used contemporary critical approaches to the study of architecture and to evaluate their strengths and weaknesses 5. recognize the structural and symbolic components of particular forms of architecture and understand how those components operate to shape culture and to influence human thought and behavior 6. appreciate and reflect on the complexity of decisions surrounding the construction of architectural projects (particularly memorial architecture and domestic architecture) 7. analyze the rhetoric of particular architectural forms, discussing the implications of those forms for human beings and the means by which those forms strategically communicate. Final grades in C425 are determined based on your performance on a midterm and final exam, three critical essays, and your written responses to discussion questions about course readings."

In the years that followed, we were forced to feel our way forward uncertainly, trying to make sense of these contradictions and resolving them in our own different ways.\x94 These words, written by Ghada Karmi, a Palestinian who struggles to assimilate into English society, tell us a great deal about why culture matters. Increasingly, culture counts in new and different ways. Cross cultural communication is a course designed to familiarize students with the cultural-ethnic factors that influence the process of human communication. A major goal of the course is to demonstrate how culture is a response to and a reflection of certain dynamics of communication (e.g., ethnicity, roots, values, language, attitudes, globalization, nonverbal elements, gender and social perception). Specific Course Objectives: 1. To provide the student with background theory and research out of which intercultural understandings grow. 2. To encourage in the student appreciation of similarities and differences among cultures. 3. To help the student develop communication skills, assisting him/her in becoming interculturally competent. Texts: The following books provide the basic reading for the course. Cooper, P., C. Calloway-Thomas, C & C. Simonds, Intercultural Communication: A Text/Reader. Boston, MA: Pearson (2007).

How do we know what makes a (good) citizen? And what kinds of activities count as citizenship? What happens when the conception of citizenship we rely upon begins to appear unjust or unworkable? Most importantly, what are the consequences for democracy of defining citizenship one way as opposed to another? Such questions have been debated at length by scholars, but we have all given them much more thought than we may even realize. Both the meaning of citizenship and the problems that beset it have long been important themes of the most familiar forms of entertainment, such as fiction film. In fact, we learn the most consequential lessons of good citizenship from movies that feel nothing like civics class and seem not to be about politics at all. This course examines the ways we collectively imagine democratic citizenship by taking a comparative approach: we will read samples of major debates about citizenship (rights vs. obligations; personal virtue vs. good institutions; abstraction vs. particularity; the challenge of multiculturalism; the promise of cosmopolitanism; etc.) and watch films in which these issues are addressed and/or imaginatively resolved. The point is to see how watching such films is in fact our most common way of \x93doing\x94 our own citizenship \x93theory,\x94 and to think about the political implications of this fact. So, students will analyze the rhetorical strategies of films in relation to theoretical readings about citizenship\x97think High Plains Drifter as a thesis about civic virtue, Die Hard with a Vengeance as a defense of liberal multiculturalism, Thelma & Louise as a critique of abstract universalism, or Bulletproof Monk as a model of hybrid cosmopolitanism."

How do the stories we tell produce both possibilities and limitations in the ways we imagine masculinity, femininity and the transgression of boundaries? Most broadly, this class asks students to think rigorously and creatively about gendered experience and its representation in narrative. We will study texts from multiple cultural and historical arenas, from both far away and close to home. We will look at various performances of gender and sexuality within a wide range of narrative genres (both scholarly and popular), including ethnography, fiction, film, memoir, the graphic novel, and the Internet. Through lecture, students will be introduced to relevant concepts in narrative and social theory. Throughout the course, as we look from the familiar to the cross- cultural, we will question what is meant by such seemingly obvious oppositions as \x93male and female,\x94 \x93the body and the imagination,\x94 \x93heterosexuality and homosexuality,\x94 and \x93the public and the private.\x94 In stories that are sometimes explicitly and sometimes implicitly about gender, we will think about how human beings negotiate gender and sexuality from their positions in familial, social, and global arenas. We will explore ideas about relationships, language and the self, from within the depiction of such topics as: medicine, authority and the body; addiction and anorexia; becoming an adult; sex-based practices of social separation; work and home; fairy tales; and captivity, trauma and memory. We will think about how gender is complicated by race and class, and explore how subjectivity and intimacy are shaped by -- and escape -- forces of power. In their papers, students will analyze the assigned texts, and/or apply concepts from class to their own social observations or experiences. For the longer paper, creative analytic work (in the form of memoir or fiction) may be accepted, provided that students discuss their ideas and obtain approval well before the assignment is due.

Three problems will be the focus of special attention in our deliberations: (1) the relationship between these two orders of performance; (2) the continuities and discontinuities between performance and other dimensions of communicative practice in social life; and (3) the relationship between convention and creativity in performance.

Generally, graduate students who will be teaching courses in the department are required to take C545 during their first semester. The quality of undergraduate teaching continues to become more important in tenure and promotion cases, and today\x92s undergraduates can have high expectations regarding the teaching abilities of their instructors. New faculty members across all types of institutions often have hundreds of students each semester and several thousand during their pre-tenure years. Substantive pedagogical training should be an integral component of preparing to enter an academic career. We will address teaching fundamentals such as planning lessons, leading discussions, fostering an interactive classroom, using technology, constructing examinations, grading oral and written work, managing instructor-student interactions, and developing a teaching portfolio. We also will recognize that these practical matters are best discussed within the context of contemporary research and pedagogical theory. In other words, we will discuss not only how to run an effective and efficient classroom, but also the intellectual and cultural implications entailed by the art of teaching. A fundamental assumption of the course is that the teaching and research activities of a university faculty member are intimately connected. Teaching and research present two sites within which scholars work to generate knowledge, influence audiences, and work for social change. We will focus on strategies for bringing research interests into the classroom, so that teaching and research are recognized as two parts of a productive whole. Students will be expected to come to class well-prepared to participate in class discussions, and will be expected to share and interrogate their own experiences as a teacher during the semester. Assignments may include a teaching journal, a book review, and a statement of teaching philosophy. For further information: <www.indiana.edu/~rterrill>"

While it helps to have had some experience with still photography, super-8, or video production, no experience is required to complete this course successfully and come away with one or two completed projects to show to others. However, because this is an elementary film class, we cannot produce any complicated or involved projects. For example, you cannot make a lip-sync sound film or a lengthy documentary.

Instructor: Gregory Waller E-Mail: gwaller@indiana.edu Office: Mottier Hall 106 Phone: 855-5721 This course will examine in detail the range of historical scholarship on American cinema, 1915-1950. Our emphasis will be on a few classic studies and several examples of recent research that expand and complicate our understanding of the history of American cinema during the heyday of classical Hollywood. We will think about the sort of questions these scholars ask, the sources they use, the arguments they make, the versions of film history they offer. While the course will provide an in-depth look at American cinema in this particular historical period, the issues raised will have broader applicability to other periods and to histories of other media. Assignments will include brief response papers and presentations in class covering select readings, an essay considering one major question related to historical research (see below for some sample questions), and a manageable research project on the history of American cinema in this period. So far as it is possible, the first part of the course will be tied to Film Indiana, the three-day conference on short films/film shorts to be held on campus in September 2007. Some questions likely to come up: Is the history of cinema necessarily a story about individual films, directors, stars, genres, and studios? What about aspects of this history that have been largely overlooked or understudied: non- feature films, educational or \x93useful\x94 cinema, porn, amateur films, home movies, commercial films made outside of the Hollywood system, program filler? What is the \x93Classical Hollywood Cinema?\x94 Is the \x93Classical Hollywood Cinema\x94 viable (or does it continue to be viable) as an explanatory model? Can or should a history of cinema incorporate non-theatrical as well as theatrical production, distribution, and exhibition? Can or should a history of cinema take into account reception and representation, with particular reference to gender, race, class, sexual preference, ethnicity, and region? What\x92s the relation between textual analysis/interpretation and historical research? Where can we find traces of the \x93foreign,\x94 the global, the transnational, and/or the international in the history of American cinema? Is the history of cinema necessarily a history of film\x92s relation with other media? How do practices of regulation, censorship, self-censorship, and state policy figure in the history of cinema?

Instructor: Jon Simons E-Mail: simonsj@indiana.edu Office: Mottier Hall 205 Phone: 856-0896 The course examines and assesses some contemporary critical thought about images, especially the role of images in politics. Rather than only pursuing various strategies for the critique of images that have become familiar as ideology critique, the course explores the possibility that it might be possible to think critically through images. It studies different types of images (in advertising, film, television, history and politics) through a variety of theoretical approaches (Marxist ideology critique, Benjamin\x92s dialectics, semiotics, psychoanalysis, visual culture and rhetoric, and neuroscience). The course also addresses the following questions and issues: whether all types of images can be considered as a category; the relation between the visual and the verbal; the non-visual as well as visual character of images; the pertinence of iconoclastic hostility to images in society and politics; and the potential for critical thought by means of images. The course opens with the view that images are a problem for politics and society, before turning around the opening negative assessment of images by looking at the ways in which media images might provide critical insight or induce critical thinking. We problematize the conception of images as only visual, leading to a deeper examination of the relation between words and images in democratic culture, then move on to some considerations of the imagistic nature of human thinking drawn from contemporary cognitive and neuroscience.

In order to make the qualitative study of new media as vigorous and grounded as possible, I suggest we 1) contextualize new media as a kind of information system coming from a rich history of \x93newness\x94 2) plumb the \x93old\x94 methodological toolbags of classical ethnography and qualitative analysis more broadly and 3) investigate what to tweak or rethink in applying qualitative analyses to the study of new media and/or its role in our lives. Focus (course goals): In this course, we will examine current understandings of what constitutes ethnography and survey texts that talk about technologies as politically complicated relations of power. From this foundation, we will address the rapidly growing body of qualitative analyses examining new media in order to better equip us to modify these principles for our own studies of \x93new media.\x94 You may approach the course in one (or both) of two ways. First, if you plan on doing ethnographic research of new media as part of your doctoral thesis, then this semester can be used for locating, gaining access to, and undertaking a pilot project at your research site, with the readings guiding you in possible themes. Your final work will be a project description. Second, you may choose to concentrate on the social and theoretical issues raised by the texts being studied. In this case, you will be expected to turn in a theoretical essay discussing general issues in the study of new media with an eye towards situating new media in these past and ongoing analyses. \x95 Because this is a 600-level course, it will provide both a survey of current scholarship in the field and specific interrogations in and across disciplines concerning the course themes. \x95 Course will be a seminar format and incorporate a course message board to facilitate discussion outside of the seminar meeting times; attendance will be taken and count towards final course evaluation. \x95 Authors studied will include Nancy Baym, John Campbell, James Clifford, David Hakken, Christine Hine, Emily Ignacio, Steve Jones, Lori Kendall, Beth Kolko, Lisa Nakamura, and Nina Wakeford. \x95 Continues themes and ideas presented in C507: Methods of Ethnographic Research in Communication and Culture. \x95 Designed to improve students\x92 abilities to critically examine the uses of ethnographic approaches in the study of new media technologies and/or the study of how media (new or otherwise) fit in the flow of everyday life and the production of cultural meaning. \x95 Assignments will include weekly written reading responses (2 pages typed); individual and group presentations with an associated paper approximately 3-5 pages in length; weekly postings of discussion questions to the course\x92s Oncourse message board; a book review (approximately 2000 words) for submission to a targeted journal or online resource identified by the student; a final project or seminar paper for presentation to the class at large.

Instructor: Ted Striphas E-Mail: striphas@indiana.edu Office: Mottier Hall 214 Phone: 856-7868 Webpage: http://www.indiana.edu/~bookworm The prospect of [introducing] cultural studies is a daunting task (or, at least, it should be). \x96 J. Macgregor Wise, \x93Cultural Studies in Words and Pictures\x94 This course introduces you to cultural studies, a diverse intellectual formation committed broadly to producing theoretically informed and politically engaged scholarship. Because cultural studies tends to shift in relation to specific geo-historical conditions, intellectual problems, and political concerns, many who are new to the field (and even some veterans, for that matter) find it difficult to pin down. Indeed the question, \x93What is cultural studies?\x94 has been posed countless times, yet rarely has it yielded satisfying or enduring answers. There\x92s something about cultural studies that seems to resist definitional closure, which indeed makes the task of introducing the field, as J. Macgregor Wise observes, \x93daunting\x94 for all involved. Rather than trying to settle once and for all what cultural studies is, this course embraces the field\x92s elusiveness by stressing its ongoing reconstitution in practice. Thus, \x93What does cultural studies do?\x94 will be our organizing motif. What\x92s so important about this question is that it enjoins us to take stock of specific formations of cultural studies while remaining sensitive to its larger project. It also encourages us to widen our frame of reference so as to encompass the signifying systems, material coordinates, and historical conjunctures out of which particular cultural studies practices have emerged. This is a course not only about cultural studies (its theories, methods, key figures, debates, etc.), therefore, but also about the field\x92s conditions of possibility. It proceeds primarily through a close reading and detailed discussion of primary works by scholars who\x92ve been at the forefront of inventing\x97and reinventing\x97cultural studies practice, with an eye towards situating their writings in determinate contexts. The reading list likely will include selections from Louis Althusser, Ien Ang, Tony Bennett, Homi Bhabha, Charlotte Brunsdon, Judith Butler, James Carey, Kuan-Hsing Chen, John Clarke, Rosalind Coward, Michel Foucault, John Fiske, Jenny Garber, Paul Gilroy, Antonio Gramsci, Lawrence Grossberg, Stuart Hall, Dick Hebdige, Richard Hoggart, Toby Miller, Meaghan Morris, Angela McRobbie, Janice A. Radway, Edward Said, Jennifer Daryl Slack, Carolyn Steedman, E.P. Thompson, and Raymond Williams, among possible others. Although this class ostensibly is about cultural studies, it is, in the end, really about the urgency of developing rigorous intellectual work that can help us to respond more effectively to the numerous political challenges\x97neoliberalism, neo-conservatism, and globalization, to name only a few\x97of our time. Otherwise, to tell you the truth, we shouldn\x92t care less about cultural studies, what it is, and what it does or doesn\x92t do."

Instructor: Karen Bowdre E-Mail: kmbowdre@indiana.edu Office: Mottier Hall 208 Phone: 855-0530 Since his debut film She\x92s Gotta Have It (1986), Spike Lee has been considered one of the leading figures in Black independent cinema. Though Lee and his films are often deemed controversial, he has established an extensive and diverse body of work in the past twenty years. Lee\x92s oeuvre includes feature films, documentaries, concert films, television programs, commercials, and music videos. In this seminar, we will examine the debates surrounding auteur theory, briefly review the history of Black independent cinema, and consider the processes involved in the production of visual media that complicate the notion of authorship. We will analyze Lee\x92s work through the following lenses: issues of authorship and genre, his position within Black independent cinema, his persona and its relationship to the promotion of his films and the topics his films address. In our analysis of Lee\x92s media, we will probe the subjects of race, class, gender, sexuality, and representation."

Instructor: Claudia Breger E-Mail: clbreger@indiana.edu Office: Ballantine 644 Phone: 855-1894 This seminar explores contemporary German avant-garde and avant- garde-inflected cinema, comparing works from three different contexts: 1. New (West-) German Cinema from the 1960\x92s and 1970\x92s, 2. a number of aesthetically unusual (and often also politically oppositional) films produced by the East German DEFA and, 3. the post-unification \x91New Berlin School\x92. As the title announces, the guiding idea is to look closely at the relations between poetics and politics, studying film languages in terms of the cultural critique they perform. In doing so, we will cover a lot of heterogeneous ground (marked, nonetheless, also by correspondences and overlap). For example, we will study the ways in which concepts of realism, the documentary and authenticity on the one hand, \x91theatrical\x92 stylistic excess on the other are configured in the (Marxist, feminist, queer) counter-cultures emerging from the West German student movement and the artistic production of East German directors struggling for political articulation space. Similarly, we will compare the critique of \x91classical\x92 narrative forms in films from the seventies and the recent \x91New Berlin School\x92 which has also been labeled as a \x91nouvelle vague allemande\x92. By thus connecting film productions from East, West and post- unification Germany, we will revisit notions of national cinema, while also studying the transnational flows which feed into the aesthetics of our different films. Exploring links between \x91dissent and distinction,\x92 we will discuss the ways in which \x91entertainment\x92 vs. \x91art\x92 or \x91avant-garde\x92 boundaries are employed, as well as challenged and redrawn, for example through the re-use of popular genres. Films to be discussed are not yet finalized, but might include R.W. Fassbinder, Katzelmacher or The Third Generation, Wim Wenders, Kings of the Road, Helke Sander, REDUPERS: Die allseitig reduzierte Pers\xF6nlichkeit, Ulrike Ottinger, Freak Orlando, Alexander Kluge, The Patriot, Frank Gerhard Klein, Berlin \x96 Sch\xF6nhauser Corner, Beyer, Carbid and Sorrel, Konrad Wolf, Der geteilte Himme/Divided Heaven, Evelyn Schmidt, The Bicycle, Benjamin Heisenberg, Schl\xE4fer, Thomas Arslan\x92s Kardesler/Geschwister, Christian Petzold, Wolfsburg (or whatever recent films I can get my hands on in subtitled versions by early fall). The class is offered for students in Germanic Studies, Communication and Culture and Cultural Studies. All materials will be available in English/with English subtitles. General reading assignments will be individualized to some degree to compensate for different backgrounds. Thus, students in German will be focusing on film theory and analysis while students in film will be focusing on German cultural history. Of course, individualized combinations of various items from both categories will be possible as well, depending on your needs. Together, we will read more specific texts pertaining to our individual films and their aesthetic strategies. Readings: 1. A course reader (on e-reserve). 2. Robert Stam.

As the basis of Christian theology and the ultimate source of Jewish law, it is held up even today as a moral guide and a source of metaphysical truth. But there is a significant strain in the Bible-- perhaps the predominant strain--that is impatient with piety and suspicious of dogmatic wis-dom, particularly the wisdom of those who presume on their knowledge of the uncanny central figure it calls God or Yahweh. Indeed, if one reads against the grain of tradition, the Bible is a book that revels in contradiction, invites questions but frustrates answers, views human morality, like divine \x93goodness,\x94 with skepticism, and treats its characters, legendary or historical, with irreverent license. In this course we shall be exploring this skeptical strain in biblical literature, beginning with the books of Ecclesiastes and Job, continuing with parts of the Pentateuch and the Deuteronomistic History, and concluding with the Gospel of Mark. Theoretical questions about the epistemology of reading (how we know what we know) will be a constant focus, but we shall approach them through specific readings and narrowly focused discussion. Secondary texts will include essays on general and special hermeneutics as well as selections from modern biblical scholarship. Students will be asked to write several short exer-cises and a final paper."

Your shift manager, your professors, your parents and your significant other: when isn\x92t someone telling you what to do? Street signs, warning labels, pop-up windows, the instructions on the back of the box: even inanimate objects boss us around. Now is the time for you to assert your right to read great literature about other people getting bossed around and to see just what they do about it. Not only will we see bullies, thugs, and egomaniacs, but also the brave and often desperate people who stand up to them. All sections of BE 145 will read Sophocles\x92 Antigone, Federico Lorca\x92s The House of Bernarda Alba, and H. G. Wells\x92 The Sleeper Awakes. In Sophocles\x92 timeless tragedy, a devoted sister must decide whether to honor her homicidal brothers or face the wrath of the state she lives in. In a Spanish village, Federico Lorca, one of the greats of modern literature, introduces us to Bernarda Alba, the mother of all mothers, as she instructs her daughters in what it means to be a respectable woman. The author who brought you The War of the Worlds and The Time Machine, H. G. Wells tells the futuristic tale of an insomniac who finally falls asleep\x97for 2oo years\x97and wakes up to discover that he literally owns the world. Now that he is the boss of everyone, what next? Our readings are drawn from different countries and time periods. Each section will read additional works unique to that section that may include short stories, poetry, novels, and drama.

Welcome to Crazytown! Chief export: mass hysteria. Favorite pastime: losing grip on reality. Say goodbye to common sense and sanity for a semester and join us as we visit families, cities, and entire states where everyone is not quite right in the head. From an ancient Greek city-state to a utopia of the 26th century, peek over the wall of social order and see what people will do when everyone else is doing it too: herd mentality run amok. Some communities destroy themselves from the inside out, while others embrace the madness of rigid conformity. And what happens to those who see Crazytown for what it is? If they\x92re lucky, they may just have their citizenship revoked. All sections of BE 146 will read Arthur Miller\x92s The Crucible, Euripides\x92 Bacchae, and We by the futurist author Yevgeny Zamyatin. In his depiction of the Salem witch trials of 1692, Arthur Miller shows us a community devouring itself in religious madness and deadly paranoia where the only proof of good citizenship is to denounce your neighbor. Religious madness also rocks the mythic city of Thebes in Euripides\x92 tragedy as the king tries to stop the arrival of a new god and his crazy followers whose newest member is the king\x92s mother. In the science fiction classic that inspired George Orwell\x92s 1984, we enter a world where technological advancement, efficiency, and uniformity define what it means to be a human being: no individuality and no emotions.

In C255, we analyze works of art (painting, music and literature) of the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries, compare how these works interrelate and discover how they are unique. We learn what motivates the creative personality and how such a person turns materials, sounds, silences and language into art. We also observe how styles in the arts change over time. Students of C255 see, hear and comprehend art in new, exciting and discriminating ways. For example, we discover how a musician paints a landscape, how a painter composes motion and how a poet creates musical and visual effects in verbal expression. By the end of the course, the student - through her/his own secured powers of discernment, increased confidence and strengthened abilities of perception - will determine what constitutes a work of art. Visits to the IU Art Museum, trips into famous paintings via slides, journeys through musical recordings and poetry readings are some of the ways we explore the artist\x92s craft. Three or four 3-4 page papers and one 6-8 page comparative paper or an equivalent comparative take-home final exam; possible group or individual project.

We will ask what kind of \x93things\x94 their works (respectively novels and films) try to be, what kind of activity they try to perform, in the context of the current situation in which humanity finds itself. Topics to be examined: the significance of the modern novel; the birth of the medium of film; popular culture and the question of a new, democratic, people; politics and art in modernity; the rise of melodrama.

Now those childhood dreams can come true. This course is an in-depth survey of texts crucial to the history and development of theories about literature and its criticism in the West from ancient Greece to Renaissance England. Despite their sometimes narrow focus, these documents spawned their own philosophy of what literature is, can be, and should be that continues to exert a strong influence today. Their technical vocabulary, interpretive points of view, and methods of reading in many ways remain unsurpassed for sophistication and subtlety. They define the sources, purposes, and machinery of literature: the nature of artistic genius; the traits of literary genres and their special language; rhetoric and audience awareness; and the connections among literature, history, philosophy, and ethics. For centuries countless poets and playwrights have thrived within the tradition constituted by these texts, while many others have expressed their creativity in opposition to them. Critics, scholars, and theorists of the arts, meanwhile, have used these same documents to praise their favorite artists, create exclusive canons of taste, and to bash anyone whose works offended them. We will read Aristotle\x92s Poetics, Longinus\x92 On the Sublime, Horace\x92s Ars Poetica, St. Augustine\x92s On Christian Teaching, Hugh of St. Victor\x92s Didascalicon, and Philip Sidney\x92s Defence of Poesy in their entireties. We will be revisiting the debate over whether literature is essentially a perversion of reality that corrupts civilization or an expression of truths that ennobles humanity. Beginning with Plato\x92s famous banishment of poets from his ideal republic, we will see the intersection of literary art and social reactions to it. We will also be reading works of literature from the same centuries to see in what ways poets and playwrights embraced, defied, or ignored the principles co ntained in the works of Aristotle and his intellectual descendents: selections from Homer\x92s Odyssey, Euripides\x92 Iphigenia among the Taurians, Geoffrey Chaucer\x92s dream visions, and Shakespeare\x92s Pericles. Workload will include an analytical essay, an annotated bibliography, and a research essay (with a separate topic proposal), as well as short papers.

Lyric poems from medieval Europe also provides us with the clearest examples of interaction between different languages, religions, and social groups during this time, especially in the Hispanic peninsula. In this course, we will examine the development of lyric poetry in Europe from the sixth century through the fifteenth century. We will study examples of religious and secular lyrics from a wide range of languages, learning about traditions and innovations in form and content, as well as the relationship between verbal text and musical setting. Some of the issues we will explore are the construction of the subject in lyric poetry, shared discourses of desire in religious and secular lyrics, and the role of dialogue within and between lyric poems (including the embedding of lyric poems in sequences and works in other genres). In addition, we will examine the relationship of musical and poetic discourses in medieval lyrics and the relationship of performance to written transmission of lyric poems. Our readings will be available in English translation, as well as their medieval languages. Recorded performances of many of the lyrics in our readings will be available for study. Students will take mid-term and final exams and write two short analytical essays (3-4 pages). (No prior knowledge about medieval music is required.)"

COMPARATIVE LITERATURE AND THE QUESTIONING OF BORDERS: RETHINKING THE WORLD, UNIVERSALISM, MULTIPLICITY One of the most pressing questions of our time is the need to rethink the concept of the world and of what it can mean for us today to live in a world, rather than exclusively within the borders of a specific nation, language, or religion. A major contribution of some of the most advanced theoretical developments of the last fifty years, this course will argue, is to allow us to develop such a rethinking of the concept of a world, thus, of that which is shared and communicated across humanity in excess of every delimiting border. This new thinking of a dimension, the dimension of the world, communicating in excess of every border, should be distinguished, we will argue, from several previous models of thinking: It should be distinguished from the dream of a cosmopolitanism, of a unification of humanity through the cancellation of the borders and languages separating it, as well as from the dream of finding the ultimate ideal of truth, value, and meaning in which all of humanity can share (enlightenment humanism). It should also be distinguished from the conception of the world as consisting of a relativistic plurality of separate and autonomous cultures, each having its own ideals and values which cannot be judged by another. If there is a dimension of humanity which communicates across borders, it will not mean the cancellation of borders but a new thinking of the logic of the border, a thinking which will also have to invent a new logic of the universal. If there is an essential thinking of multiplicity in this new logic, it will not be the thinking of a relativistic plurality of separate and complete entities, but of an essential multiplicity of fragmented and incomplete entities exposed to each other. It is the task of comparative literature, we will argue, to become the discipline activating this new thinking of the borders and of the discovery of a new notion of the world, and it will be the task of this class to elaborate this new way of thinking by creating a framework through which to think together several of the essential theoretical contributions of our time."

Despite their sometimes narrow focus, these documents spawned their own philosophy of what literature is, can be, and should be that continues to exert a strong influence on modern and post-modern authors, critics, and theorists. Their technical vocabulary, interpretive strategies, and methods of reading in many ways remain unsurpassed for sophistication and subtlety. They define the sources, purposes, and machinery of literature: the nature of artistic genius; the traits of literary genres and their distinctive discourses; rhetoric and audience awareness; and the connections among literature, history, philosophy, and ethics. Until the advent of romanticism in the Occident, the aesthetic tradition represented by these documents set the standards for defining artistic production and its critical evaluation. The very notions of the literary canon, critical standards, and the liberal arts curriculum have their roots ultimately in these pre-modern texts. We will also be reading works of literature from the same centuries to see in what ways poets and playwrights embraced, defied, or ignored the principles contained in the works of Aristotle and his intellectual descendents: selections from Homer\x92s Odyssey, Euripides\x92 Iphigenia among the Taurians, Geoffrey Chaucer\x92s dream visions, and Shakespeare\x92s Pericles. Throughout the semester we will be looking at such issues as rhetoric, poetics, aesthetics (both religious and secular), artistic production and consumption, audience and social class, critical reception, \x93literary\x94 versus \x93non-literary\x94 discourses, methods of reading, nationalism in literature and criticism, canon formation, theories of genre, and sign theory. Throughout the semester, graduate students will be encouraged to identify connections and discontinuities between these pre-modern theories and the modern and post-modern theories more common to contemporary academic research. Workload will include an analytical essay, an annotated bibliography, detailed topic proposal, required individual conferences, and a research essay, as well as short papers. This course will meet with CMLT-C405. For further information, contact Jeffrey Johnson at jwjohnso@indiana.edu."

One manifestation of this image in medieval European literature is the naming of a text as \x93mirror\x94 or \x93speculum.\x94 Mirrors also serve as images of self-conscious artistry in lyrics by Yehuda Halevi, Bernart de Ventadorn, and Lombarda de Toulouse. Often, references to literal mirrors refract through a text in the form of metaphoric mirrors or instances of narrative mirroring. In this course, we will explore the significance of the mirror as an image in medieval literature, especially as the image relates to the depiction of text as mirror and the reading/writing process as an act of philosophical speculation or reflection. Issues for our consideration will include the extent to which the material world is represented as the mirror image of God, language is represented as the mirror image of nature, and women are represented as the mirror images of men. How did medieval theories of vision shape mirror images? How do (post) modern readings of these texts also benefit from application of the concepts of mirroring in the theories of Bakhtin, Derrida, Lacan, or Irigaray? Our primary readings will include Dhuoda\x92s Manual for William, Alain de Lille\x92s Complaint of Nature, Wolfram von Eschenbach\x92s Parzival, Guillaume de Lorris and Jean de Meun\x92s Romance of the Rose, Heldris of Cornwall\x92s Romance of Silence, Marguerite Porete\x92s Mirror of Simple Souls, Dante\x92s Divine Comedy, and selected lyric poems. The primary readings will be supplemented with readings in medieval and modern critical and theoretical works. Students will make two class presentations (one on a secondary reading and one on the comparative research project the student has chosen), prepare a written proposal for the research project at mid-term, and complete the written presentation of the research project for the end of the semester."

There has been consensus on this point, and it has meant that the new nations emerging from colonial empires had to \x93produce novels in order to certify their distinct and modern nationhood\x94 (Lynch and Warner, Cultural Institutions of the Novel). This seminar will consider the importance of the novels from the formerly colonized spaces, their common denominators of socio-political (in) justice and \x93writing back to the center\x94 (Ashcroft, et al.), and how they have affected our understanding of novels and literature more broadly from the late twentieth century to the present. We will reflect on the location of the novelist, the readership of such novels, and the usefulness of the category \x93postcolonial,\x94 what it enables and what it forecloses. We will do readings on the novel as a genre and on postcolonialism--from C\xE9saire and Fanon, Said and Jameson to Bhabha and Spivak, McClintock, Moretti, and Cassanova. Alongside the classics of postcolonialism we will examine other texts that may disrupt or challenge the category. We will read novelists representative of varied national and cultural spheres, such as Chinua Achebe (Nigeria), Miguel Asturias (Guatemala), Miguel Asturias (South Africa), Assia Djebar (Algeria), Nuruddin Farah (Somalia), Kim Lefevre (Vietnam/France), Toni Morrison (U.S.), Herta Muller (Romania), Ngugi wa Thiongo (Kenya), Ben Okri (Nigeria/Britain), Salman Rushdie (India/Britain), Simone Schwarz- Bart and Daniel Maximin (Guadeloupe/France)."

It will explore how the novel\x97a genre that is poor in formal conventions\x97relies on temporality to give life its specific contours: narrative is meaningful to the extent that it portrays temporal experience. Its essence is the repertoire of meaning unfolding within the limits of finitude in which beings are enclosed. The nineteenth century sees the intrusion of time into history, biology, economy and psychoanalysis. Whereas traditional metaphysics situates essence outside temporality and conceives becoming as teleological, time now defines how and why the beings populating the world are what they are. Life is in essence limited and unfolds its finite resources in the dimensions of history and biology. The novel is the genre that corresponds to the modern way of being in the world and its rise to the most prominent among the modern genres may well be due to its formal indetermination. Thus the course will question the link between time, the novel as a genre, and the sciences of man. We will examine a selection of texts by Darwin, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Ricardo and Freud to trace the emergence of temporality in the positive sciences, and discuss novels such as Flaubert\x92s \xC9ducation sentimentale, Fontane\x92s Effi Briest, and Stifter\x92s Nachsommer.

Often, however, it is not possible for the subject of study to be investigated directly and empirically, and, even when it is possible, it turns out that a very useful way to gain insights into scientific phenomena is to build models of them. Mathematics provides methods for the analysis of data. It also provides tools for building models of objects, states and processes studied in the different specific areas of science. The purpose of this course is to introduce students to some of the main mathematical and logical tools used in building models in cognitive science. The emphasis will be on the intuitive ideas behind the mathematics, i.e. the main goal will be to have the students learn the ideas first at an intuitive level and then to go towards a deeper acquaintance with the ideas. The course will introduce the main concepts and results from first-order logic, machines, set theory, and linear algebra for parallel distributed processing (neural networks), The lab hours will be devoted primarily to the use of computational tools, including Matlab. The material for the course is self-contained an no prerequisites beyond a sound high school mathematics background are needed."

We will look at how theoretical challenges to computationalism combined with recent work > in robotics, dynamical systems theory, cognitive neuroscience, and artificial life contribute to an emerging conception of mind that emphasizes embodiment and action. We will explore experimental and philosophical treatments of concepts such as symbol,representation, meaning, and concept (itself).

In order to evaluate the significance of these ideas, this course will examine the construction and analysis of models of complete brain-body-environment systems. Specifically, we will explore the use of evolutionary algorithms to evolve agents that can accomplish given tasks in given environments and the use of tools from dynamical systems theory to study how the evolved agents work. Behaviors to be studied range from basic motor behavior and sensorimotor learning to categorical perception and selective attention. The course will combine reading and discussion of current conceptual and modeling work in this area with the techniques required for students to evolve and analyze their own model agents."

    :description: "Lecture MW 12:20-1:10pm, Discussion Th 9:05-9:55am This course examines the nature of human language from a variety of perspectives and explores the complex interrelationship between language and thought. It serves to introduce students to current language-related issues in the social and behavioral sciences, addressing questions such as: How is human language structured? What does it mean to \x93know\x93 a language?; How is this knowledge acquired?; What happens when linguistic ability is impaired? To what extent are language and thought independent?; Is language a uniquely human capacity?; How can human languages differ?; What properties do they all share?; What are Sign Languages? How do languages change? Readings: S. Pinker, The Language Instinct F. Parker & K. Riley Linguistics for Non-Linguistics various articles, t.b.a. The honors discussion will be run by professor. (The three regular discussions will be run by an AI.) The honors students will be assigned extra topical readings and will be required, in addition to completing the regular homework assignments and exams, to write a short paper."

    :credit: "10"
    :description: "Lecture MW 10:10-11:00am, Discussion Th 3:35-4:25pm Are we as humans separate from animals or are we all in it together? In this course, students will explore how other cultures have addressed this question using archaeology, ethnography, historical texts, and literature. We will explore how people\x92s interactions with animals are varied and unique across cultures and through time, and how anthropologists specifically have tried to address these issues. Portions of the course will be devoted to food and identity; hunting and herding; domestication; pets as companions; symbolism in art and culture; use of animals as laborers, in captivity, and on display; origins of the American conservation movement; ethics of medical research; animals as pathways of disease; and human interactions with living primates. This course will include contemporary examples from across the globe, as well as historical examples in Native North America, Native South America, Southeast Asia, and Ice Age Europe. This course will be interdisciplinary in focus and will introduce students to perspectives on human interactions with animals within anthropology, archaeology, biology, zoology, history, and the humanities. Sections will include discussions, debates, and hands- on components. This class is approved for Credit for the Anthropology Minor, Science and Social Medicine Minor, and as a College of Arts and Sciences Topics Course. The honors section of COLL E104 will meet for a weekly discussion section in which students will have an opportunity to participate in more critical assessments of case studies and in a rotation through the Indiana University Zooarchaeology Laboratory. Students will also become participant observers at local sites of people-animal interaction, which may include the Monroe County humane society, PALS (people and animal learning services), and the Indianapolis Zoo."

    :credit: "2"
    :description: Lecture MW 2:30-3:20pm, Discussion th 2:30-3:20pm This course explores the language of politics. In particular, it examines how politicians or political actors and political commentators use language to talk about politics and how politics also influences language. We will examine the speeches of politicians, party propaganda, slogans, and other discourse types aimed at influencing the political process. Also examined is the language used in communicative events like congressional or parliamentary sessions, cabinet meetings, state of the union address, and so forth. The political actors whose language will be examined include presidents and vice-presidents, members of Congress, parliamentarians, senators, governors, and action group members. Because the course involves investigating how language and politics influence each other, the course will cross disciplines like political science, journalism, and communication. To help broaden students' perspectives on language and politics the course will not focus exclusively on language and politics in the United States. To this end, the course will occasionally cross cultural/national boundaries by observing data from the United Kingdom and non-Western cultures, especially Africa (Ghana).

This class provides a broad introduction to the region through two strategies. First, we will individually consider the recent political and economic histories of these countries. And second, we will consider how several important issues \x96 from globalization to human rights, from the environment to the demographic changes \x96 variously affect the countries and peoples of the region. Readings average 50 pages/week and are drawn from two textbooks, literature, the popular media, and other primary sources. Assignments include two practical exercises, a paper, two reading quizzes, a midterm, and a final exam. The course is designed for students with little to no background or knowledge of East Asia.

Our discussions will explore the layered significance of dwelling places in Japanese culture: their architectural and symbolic qualities; their function as embodiments of social power or social structures; as settings for specific kinds of social or political relations; and as the means for relations with what does not partake of the social (haunted houses; ruins; and the recluse\x92s hut as expressive of an ideal relation to the natural world and the value of solitude).

    :description: "\"Japanese Families\" will introduce students to the study of Japan from the perspective of sociology. It will center on one of the major policy questions in contemporary Japan \"Why do Japanese families have so few children?\" If birth rates in Japan remain as low as they are today the Japanese people could disappear entirely within three centuries, a situation unprecedented in human history. To investigate this question we need to ask about the history of families in Japan, about housing in the Japanese landscape, about gender roles, about women's and men's opportunities in the workplace, about housework, about child care, and about care of the elderly. The course will use a variety of material to explore these issues, including articles, books, videos and explorations of one's own personal experiences with these issues. Students will be expected to take three short tests and to complete a research paper at the end of the semester. Returning women and men students are especially invited to take this course, even if they have no experience with Japan or Asia."

    :number: E352 23931
    :subject: EALC
    :credit: "0"
    :description: All modern societies have shown great interest in defining what constitutes the good life, the values and experiences that ought to inform a life of meaning led well and the social settings and professions in which these might best be achieved. These definitions are usually, of course, greatly idealized and tell us as much about the anxieties of an age as about any truly existing social conditions. We will consider the ways in which Japanese during the twentieth century set about defining what they saw as particularly Japanese forms of the good life. In the process we will explore the ways in which these visions of social value and individual experience often reflected a tension between the demand for constant change during the modern period and a desire for locating fixed, transcendent values immune from the disruptions of the present. We will discover, moreover, the ways in which all industrializing societies experiencing the dislocations of older social arrangements have sought to pin down a definition of the good life quite similar, in fact, to those Japanese were expressing at the same time. Topics covered will include ideals regarding career and personal ambition, consumption and urban lifestyles, the notion of the countryside as the home of true Japanese values, and discourses lamenting what is described as "lost Japan." 3 credits

While exploring the concept of \"women's writing\" as a literary genre, we will examine how fiction illustrates the shifts and continuities of various female roles and the Japanese family structure over a hundred-year period.

  - :name: Contemporary Chinese Politics
    :number: E390 27237

    :credit: ""
    :description: "There is a fierce debate amongst observers of China\x92s domestic political scene: Is the Chinese state\x92s ability to effectively govern growing or declining? Either trend has critical implications for the rest of the world. A strong Chinese state, for better or worse, will have greater influence over its neighbors and in international institutions. A weak Chinese state will not be able to sustain economic growth, protect the environment, or manage disputes among conflicting interests, with clear negative spillover effects for the world. This broad question will be considered through a discussion of four topics: 1) trends and patterns in elite politics; 2) the evolving nature of the policymaking process; 3) political activism of average Chinese; and 4) the relative likelihood of continued Communist Party rule, democratization, or collapse in the near future. To better understand China, we will regularly make comparisons with politics elsewhere. We use secondary readings by outside observers, primary documents by political insiders, media reports, and film documentaries. No previous study of Chinese history or politics or knowledge of the Chinese language is required. This course is cross-listed with POLS-Y 333"

    :description: This course analyzes Japan's modern politico economic system. In all countries today, it is the interaction between government policy and business activity which determines economic success or failure. We will examine the causes of Japan's economic success, without ignoring its costs or the conflicts that remain unresolved within the system. Major topics will include business organization, labor management relations, assembly line techniques, the role of women, and state policy toward industry, welfare, and the environment. We will also study recent issues of economic contention between Japan and the United States. Required work includes two exams and an 8 page research paper.

    :number: E395 27235
    :subject: EALC
    :credit: "0"
    :description: This course covers the political, military, and economic aspects of Japan's foreign relations. Japan is responsible for roughly 10 percent of the world's industrial production. It is a huge investor in the U.S., one of the biggest trading partners of both Western and other Asian countries, and often the world's largest donor of foreign aid. Its trade relations with other countries have long been a source of friction and controversy. In security affairs, Japan adopted a low profile after World War II, but in recent years this has begun to change. Japan's military budget is now one of the five largest in the world, its troops participate in foreign military operations, and the threat from North Korea has opened new possibilities for Japanese security policy. With due attention to the cultural and historical dimensions of Japan's interaction with the rest of the world, this course will focus on these military and economic facets of Japanese foreign policy. Credit given for only one of EALC E350, E395 and POLS Y362 on this topic.

    :description: "The theme of E354 this semester will be the impact and meanings of the spread of literacy among the non-elite sectors of Japanese society in the Early Modern Period (roughly the late 16th to the early 20th centuries). Among the broad questions to be considered will be: Who benefits from the spread of literacy? Who loses out when technologies of communication improve? Who is threatened? What are the primary determinants of literacy spread? How might understand the nature of literacy in the past help us to understand the social impact of computers and the internet in our own day? We will look at how conflict in Tokugawa villages provided political motivations for literacy for some. We will also look at the implications for literacy of expanding commercial opportunities. Book publishing and lending libraries in the cities will be studied along with poetry salons and scholarly networks in provincial areas. We will look at the rise of provincial literati in the 18th century, and the proliferation of writing schools in the 19th. Finally we will consider the persistence of illiteracy in Japan and the reasons for it. There will be short written responses to readings, a midterm, and a final examination. 3 credits Class meets with EALC-E 354"

    :number: E604 27239
    :subject: EALC
    :credit: ""
    :description: This seminar is designed to familiarize you with the structures of scholarship on East Asia in a number of disciplines. As such this course surveys East Asia as a whole. By structures we mean the questions and assumptions that have guided scholarship on East Asia from early studies that shaped the field, to post-war writings, and more recent work that has overturned what had become established beliefs. We hope to come to an understanding of just how we have arrived in the current, more pluralistic scholarly environment of today. The goal is for students to become familiar with the broader changes in intellectual approaches in the East Asian studies field and therefore be able to negotiate, adapt, accept, or reject various approaches as they begin their own work. The course will also introduce students to a number of East Asian specialists working at IU. IU East Asian studies professors representing a number of disciplines will join our discussions. Their names are listed in parentheses in the weekly schedule We will devote our time to rigorous discussion of weekly readings. Discussions will be shaped by student reading reactions that will be due weekly. Readings will be available on the E-Reserves (password PRESENT) of the Main Library, in Xerox form, or on-line. Each week several students will assume responsibility for leading our discussions of the readings. Unless otherwise specified, readings are available on the EReserves at the BMain Library. Some readings are from books available at the IMU Bookstore, and others are on- line.

Students will continue to develop the four skills (listening, speaking, reading and writing) as well as cultural proficiency. The aim of the course is to help students become autonomous lifelong learners of Japanese. The class meets five times a week and all classes will be conducted mainly in Japanese. In three of the classes (MWF), students will be introduced to the new materials and in two of the classes (TR), students will practice the materials introduced in MWF classes. Students will be graded on the basis of classroom attendance and performance, homework assignments, quizzes and tests, and midterm and final exams."

Students will be introduced to the grammatical forms and rhetorical modes of expression in literary Japanese by learning to read them in the original and to translate them into reasonably literary English. We will be reading from a variety of brief prose and lyric texts (most of them excerpted from longer works), representing the diverse range of styles employed by writers of the mid to late Heian period (early 10th through early 13th centuries). Depending on class interest, we will also look at texts from the Kamakura period and later. Prerequisite: Proficiency in Japanese above the third year level. No prior knowledge of classical Japanese grammar is expected. N.B. Advanced undergraduates are welcome. The course may be used to fulfill EALL/Japanese major requirements.

Art-education majors may substitute this course for one Art History requirement in the Visual Art Certification Program...) This course, taught by a former museum educator, emphasizes both art- museum and popular-culture image in exploring ways to introduce students to the media, subjects, functions, and stylistic traditions of artful imagery across cultures and time periods. Class sessions involve slide lecture; discussion and critique; in-class explorations of techniques for using art images as prompts for writing, social studies, and science (and some math) classroom activities; brainstorming about other subject links to using images, museum visits; and minimal (ungraded!) hands-on activities for re- interpreting imagery for personal expression. Assignments include short writing assignments about images encountered in everyday life, lesson-plan development and presentation, self-reflection through journal entries, analysis and some research of objects in area museums, and the development of a theme-based unit. Prior knowledge of art history is not required; students with some art history background will be able to use that experience appropriately."

The course closely integrates process objectives with discipline- specific content to pursue two main objectives: (1) to help students acquire critical thinking and writing skills important for successful graduate study; and (2) to acclimate international students to the conventions and expectations of academic study in the United States as well as to the US educational system. To provide a context for students\x92 later study in the field of curriculum and instruction, the content for the course focuses on \x93American Schooling: History, Policy, and Issues.\x94 In our survey of the US educational system, we shall overview the establishment and evolution of the common (public) school. We shall then examine the expanding federal role in education, from the middle of the last century to the present day, by reflecting on the formation of policy that created Head Start, Title I, inclusion, and legislation that mandated strict accountability for schools (No Child Left Behind). Next, we shall consider contemporary issues at the forefront of public discourse about public education (e.g., early intervention for children in poverty, \x93high-stakes testing,\x94 teacher accountability, and more), and suggested ways of resolving them. Through independent research, students will have an opportunity to explore topics in their area of specialization. A field-based emphasis will make it possible for students to observe course content first hand\x97 that is, to integrate theory with practice. We shall accomplish this goal by visiting two or three different school settings. Early in the semester, we shall discuss as a class how to arrange these visits. Judith A.

This course introduces students to important authors, influential texts, and historical and cultural contexts of English and American literatures from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries. To that end, we will identify and practice strategies for reading and writing about literature that represents a variety of genres, conventions, and techniques as we strive to acquire a greater understanding and appreciation of works by Sidney, Donne, Herbert, Jonson, Milton, Dryden, Swift, Pope, and Johnson on the one side of the Atlantic, and Bradstreet, Wigglesworth, Taylor, and Franklin, among others, on the other side. Receiving special attention in this section of the course will be issues related to the various conceptions of the function of poetry and the role of the poet that emerge and develop throughout our period. Because much of the work of this course will be carried on through class discussion and other class activities, regular attendance and participation will be required. Also required will be a number of \x93first pass\x94 exercises, two formal essays, a midterm and a final exam.

TOPIC: \x93Voices of the Nineteenth Century\x94 The expanding world offered to nineteenth-century readers was haunted by voices: from the vox populi or democratic \x93voice of the people\x94 that announced the new century, to the sputtering, intermittent voices that crackled out from new machines \x96 telephones and phonographs \x96 at century\x92s end. It was a world where face-to- face encounters, even between family members, could grow less frequent; where print media rapidly filled in for oral communication; where news traveled not simply from household to household, but from continent to continent. At the same time, the English language with its literature found itself increasingly in the company of other tongues. As it was carried to the ends of empire, English itself was altered: in the accent and additions of a Jamaican or Canadian, a Kentuckian or Brahmin Indian, English in the nineteenth century could sound foreign to itself \x96 if indeed, in the growing Anglophone empire, anyone had a right to say what English \x93itself\x94 sounded like. Finally, modernity\x92s devotion to the promises of science and capitalism seemed to announce a waning from the world of the voice of divinity: prophecy was threatened by rational calculation and formulas for prediction. Not surprisingly the period fostered a culture of psychic mediums and spiritualists, poised to channel voices from other realms. It was a world both losing its voice and struggling to make intelligible so many disparate voices. Nineteenth-century literary works in English \x96 printed on a page, increasingly standardized in grammar and punctuation \x96 struggled with their relationship to the embodied human voice. We will begin the course by reading the American Declaration of Independence (meant to be read aloud to the new citizenry), and proceed with texts gathered from the newly formed United States as well as Great Britain and the growing Anglophone world. The course will feature novels, stories, speeches, poems and plays by writers such as Charles Brockden Brown, William Blake, William Wordsworth, Sojourner Truth, Emily Bronte, Frederick Douglass, Robert Browning, Amy Levy, Manmohan Ghose, Edgar Allan Poe, Abraham Lincoln, George Bernard Shaw, William James, and James Joyce. At the end of the semester, thanks to the miracle of phonographic recording, we will listen to actual transcriptions of nineteenth-century voices. We\x92ll take advantage of another nineteenth-century invention, the moving picture, to supplement the syllabus with two (fairly recent) films. The course will require attentive reading out of class and spirited voices in class! There will be two 6-8 page papers required and one long research project due at the end of the semester; you will also be asked to contribute bi-weekly written responses to the reading. Please contact me (favretm@indiana.edu) if you have questions about the course or would like to start your reading over the summer."

TOPIC: \x93Travelers\x92 Tales: Exploration and Adventure in American and British Writing\x94 The twentieth century marked the peak of global exploration motivated by imperial ambition and missionary zeal, commercial interest and scientific curiosity. This course considers the record of that movement in British and American writing during the past hundred years. Through our reading of fictional and non-fictional narratives of travel, exploration, and adventure we will explore the following questions: How did English-speaking writers come to know and exercise imaginative control over the world beyond their native lands? What are the conventions necessary to literary narratives presenting the relationship between the West and the rest; how were they created, maintained or subverted? What role does race and gender play in the making of western and \x93native\x94 persons? And how have the rest used the tropes of exploration to contest and rewrite their place in the Anglo-American imagination? Our principle destinations will be Africa, Antarctica, India and South America. We will explore several modes of rendering other people and places including popular and cinematic representations. Our literary guides will likely include Owen Wister, Joseph Conrad, Charlotte Perkins Gilman and Salman Rushdie. This course requires two papers (3-5 typewritten pages, double- spaced), two exams, one research team project, active and informed classroom participation and attendance."

But it also demands some attention to the history and prehistory of the language, particularly its phonology. And so the normal business of the course will be the day-to-day translation of texts in class, supplemented by lectures on the structure and history of the language. We will be reading texts in prose and verse and studying such aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture as runic inscriptions, the making of manuscripts, survivals of pagan and folkloristic belief, and the history of the period, especially the devastating Viking invasions. But this is primarily a language course, so most of our time will be devoted to studying the structure of the Old English language. There will be two or three examinations, along with some shorter assignments, and a final project that will involve a paper of no more than ten pages. The textbooks will be John C. Pope's Eight Old English Poems and Dorothy Whitelock\x92s revision of Sweet\x92s Anglo-Saxon Reader, supplemented by an Old English grammar available through Oncourse. Meets with G405."

    :description: This course will consider what it means to play, and why humans need to do it. The great Dutch historian, Johann Huizinga, once argued that our species should be called homo ludensCAman the player.@ But Huizinga also pointed out that many social animals have play behaviors that are essential to individual ans group development. The activities that can be considered play range from two puppies Anipping@ each other to Greek tragic theater, from the most sacred religious rituals to sporting contests and off-color jokes. In this course, we will take an exploratory approach to the problem, reading and viewing a number of examples of play, analyzing them for their implications about how we interpret our world. Is warfare a game? If not, what is going on in Fight Club? Are jokes, laughter, and humor modes of Amake-believe@ designed to produce group cohesion? Then why is Joe Pesci so scary in Goodfellas when he makes people laugh? When does play become more important than real life? Why are religious or patriotic symbols treated as though they are the Areal@ things, when everyone knows they=re Amake-believe@? Why do people think that reading novels or going to the theater might be good for your moral development? This class will ask you to think hard, read carefully, write often, and open your mind to novel ideas and different cultures and times. Writing instruction will emphasize brainstorming, analysis, revisionCand how to combine all these in polished essays. Two lectures and two sections per week.

If she could speak, what would she say? What does she think about me?\x94 Have you ever fantasized about what it would be like to become an animal? From the late nineteenth century onwards, many literary authors have had these sorts of thoughts, and have created a body of compelling and important work that examines human relationships with animals and attempts imaginatively to enter their consciousnesses. We\x92ll begin with Anna Sewall\x92s 1877 best- seller Black Beauty: the Autobiography of a Horse and H.G. Wells\x92 creepy. 1903 scientific fable The Island of Dr. Moreau. From there, we\x92ll go on to encounter many more dreams, nightmares, fables, and speculations about animals, usually in relation to those humans who control, dominate, and sometimes befriend them. Much of the course will focus on such early twentieth-century Modernist authors as Virginia Woolf, Franz Kafka, D.H. Lawrence, William Faulkner, and Rainer Maria Rilke, for whom animal narrators and subjects offered a path to literary and philosophical innovation and experiment. In the last month or so of the semester, though, we\x92ll turn to more contemporary fiction and film, including Peter Dickinson\x92s 1988 young- adult novel Eva (about a girl who wakes up as a chimpanzee), Yann Martel\x92s 2002 Booker Prize-winning The Life of Pi, Nobel Prize winner J.M. Coetzee's The Lives of Animals (1999), and two amazing films, Charles Burnett\x92s Killer of Sheep (1977) and Werner Herzog\x92s Grizzly Man (2005). The readings will focus on fiction but will also include some poetry and critical essays. We\x92ll focus on skills of literary interpretation and analysis and effective argumentation and writing. Assignments will include regular short response papers, three 4-6 page formal papers (one of which can take a \x93creative\x94 option \x96 fiction, poetry, or possibly visual art), regular on-time readings of all assigned texts. dedicated class participation, and a take- home final essay exam."

TOPIC: \"The Literary and Legal Animal\" Have you ever pondered the lives of animals and the kinds of relationships you personally have to animals? Have you asked yourself what it means to \"love\" animals, or \"not love\" them? What kinds of moral/ethical obligations, if any, do you think we owe animals? Where do you fall on the spectrum of animal welfare and animal rights? Do you believe that animals should be free of needless suffering? Do you think animals have a right to happiness? If so, what does animal happiness look like? We will look at some of these complex issues through literature and law. Should animals we view as pets be given different treatment from animals we consume for food and clothing? We will pursue \"the question of the animal\"--- -that is, our relationships and interactions with, uses and treatment of----by blending literary texts (novels, stories, essays, and poems) with essays by various philosophers, ethicists, ethologists, and lawyers. There will likely be a couple of films, as well. We will look at how these various representations reflect and shape societal attitudes which, in turn, reflect and shape our laws. Assignments will include regularly assigned response papers and weekly essay quizzes, at least one paper on a topic of your choice, and an exam. Dedication to active and participation in discussions and careful preparation of the assignments in advance of class are absolutely essential.

Contrary to popular ideas of the Middle Ages, it was a culture that invented our modern concept of love and that understood sex and sexuality in much more complex ways than we do today. Although many people assume the medieval church somehow policed and censored medieval sexual expression, in fact, the church of the Middle Ages was much less interested in controlling sexuality than many modern religious movements are. In this course, we will investigate medieval attitudes towards sex and gender through a variety of texts, including works by Chaucer, the Gawain poet, Margery Kempe, Marie de France, and many others. Many of the texts we read will be in Middle English, which students will learn to read and translate, as well as pursue its words for sex and gender concepts. In addition, the course will include critical and historical commentary on the issues we are studying.

How do they represent the interactions between their characters within broader social environments? How do these novels represent different social, national, and ethnic groups? H do they represent different genders? By means of what literary devices do they do all this? My aims in the course are to give you a better understanding of the fiction of the period and to see how the devices used by these authors to understand their psychological, ethical and political worlds continue to bear on our own understanding of our lives and world.

TOPIC: \x93American Gothic\x94 Why did Gothic fiction become popular in the late eighteenth century, and again at the end of the nineteenth? Put otherwise, why, in two eras known for their leaps forward into \x93modernity\x94 and attendant discourses of progress (political modernity in the 1700s, with the French and American Revolutions, and cultural modernity in the 1800s, with industrialization, urbanization, and the rise of consumer culture), would authors and audiences turn to writings that speak to the darkest, least \x93civilized\x94 recesses of the human psyche? These questions are particularly intriguing to address in the context of the United States, where Nathaniel Hawthorne once argued it was almost impossible to write a Gothic work (or \x93romance\x94) due to the nation\x92s cheery disposition, its many freedoms, and its lack of a gloomy feudal past. And yet the fiction of Hawthorne\x92s nineteenth-century America in fact overflows with Gothic texts (very much including Hawthorne\x92s own). We\x92ll explore how this could have been the case, and what ongoing questions about modernity and its potential \x93dark side\x94 the American Gothic can still pose to us as readers today. Topics will include: the Gothic and modern science; the Gothic and slavery; the Gothic and marriage; the Gothic and the rise of evolutionary theory. Readings will most likely include short stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Charles Chesnutt, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, and Mary Wilkins Freeman, and longer works by Charles Brockden Brown, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Louisa May Alcott, Pauline Hopkins, Stephen Crane, Frank Norris, and Henry James. We'll also look at slave narratives by Frederick Douglass and Harriet Jacobs, and at the beginning of the class we will ground our investigations in a couple of pertinent essays by Sigmund Freud.

Students enrolling in this class should expect a seminar (not a lecture) and be ready to participate actively in a hands-on (\"workshop\"), actively reading/discussing essays exemplary of current critical practice and writing about them. We will take an eclectic approach. Our primary category for analysis will be \"meaning and pleasure\" and we will use these categories to examine a variety of critical and theoretical assumptions about texts and how they mean. Readings will include examples from psychoanalytic, deconstructive, structuralist and poststructuralist, French feminist, materialist, postcolonial, and queer theories. While you will gain a good sense of the intellectual history of contemporary critical methods, our primary commitment will be to ask questions about the meaning, value, and implications of various critical perceptions and aesthetic experiences. We will emphasize careful reading, engaged discussion, and focused writing. Authors to be read include Roland Barthes, Luce Irigaray, Michel Foucault, Louis Althusser, Jacques Lacan, Homi Bhabha, Barbara Johnson, Herman Melville, Jeanette Winterson, J.M.

NOTE: The English Department will strictly enforce this prerequisite. Students who have not completed L202 with a grade of C- or better will have their registration administratively cancelled. This course will be organized around a set of critical approaches, such as formalism, structuralism, post-structuralism, psychoanalysis, Marxism, post-colonial and ethnic studies, feminism and queer studies. Rather than provide an exhaustive survey of critical theory, we will concern ourselves with investigating the ways in which these critical approaches conceptualize the relationship between narrative, on the one hand, and history, on the other. In addition to analyzing the conceptions of representation that underwrite our readings, we will contextualize them within the history of contemporary literary theory and social movements. Throughout the course, we will ask: what is the connection between representation in the mimetic sense and political representation in the public sphere? And what sorts of ethical, moral, and political responsibilities are attendant on being an intellectual today? We will approach individual readings fairly systematically by inquiring how each text 1) defines its object of investigation; 2) organizes its argument by ascertaining its key critical terms, its structure, and the kinds of evidence it employs; 3) contains conceptual gaps which cannot be elaborated within the terms of the argument. There are three required texts: Terry Eagleton's Literary Theory: An Introduction; Vincent B. Leitch's edited collection The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism and David Lodge's Nice Work. Students should expect to write one 5-6 page paper and one 8-10 page paper, and to take three exams."

TOPIC: \x93Post-WWII British Literature\x94 The second half of the twentieth century has been a tumultuous period for England, both materially and symbolically. The era began with the nation emerging from war at once victorious and devastated, and still ruling an enormous but increasingly rebellious empire. Then followed an ambitious experiment with socialism, the development and eventual fragmentation of the welfare state, decolonization, increased migration, and attendant seismic changes in the class structure, gender relations, and racial affiliations of the population. The literary texts for this class interrogate the idea of England by re-visiting significant moments of national history. They also re-narrate national myths, often by invoking ironically the aesthetic gestures and literary precursors most valued by their nation. We will discuss the habit of measuring national character and distinctiveness through a literary tradition, and ask how writers respond to the burden of national representation. We will attend to the generic conventions of plays, novels, and the occasional cinematic text, and will track aesthetic shifts in the period from the realist to the postmodern, and from the postcolonial to historiographic metafiction. Readings likely will include J.B. Priestly, John Osborne, Tom Stoppard, Caryl Churchill, Kazuo Ishiguro, Pat Barker, Michael Ondaatje, Salman Rushdie, Julian Barnes, and Kwame Kwei-Armah. Assignments will include two analytical essays, a mid-term examination and a final examination, and may include informal writing and in-class presentations."

As a complicated dream vision that exists in three different versions, Langland\x92s poem mobilizes a complex and tumultuous historical moment in his poem, giving voice to a variety of theological and political positions. At times ambivalent, at times conflictual, Langland\x92s poem in the B- Text was nevertheless a flash point for the 1381 Peasant\x92s Revolt. This course will be devoted to reading Langland\x92s text in the Middle English with a number of goals in mind: a) to examine the layering of personal dream vision with a conscious engagement in political issues surround the three estates, an exchange economy, the corruption of the medieval Church, and just about everything that was up for grabs in late medieval England; b) We will also consider how the poem\x92s textual history affects its interpretation by comparing it to excerpts from the A- and C-texts, as well as to other allegorical poems, particularly the Romance of the Rose, and to Chaucer\x92s dream visions; c) we will take up different critical traditions that have built up around this poem, including recent theoretical approaches.

Spenser=s culturally encyclopedic romance-epic is the most important poem of the English High Renaissance and the equivalent for poetry of what Shakespeare is for the drama in the period. Milton=s epic is probably the single most influential poem ever written in English, and is has a close relationship to Spenser=s. We=ll also be considering ideas about metaphor and allegory as we proceedCthe latter most simply defined in the Renaissance as continued metaphor. Allegory is basic to all forms of representation in language, and it conspicuously affects writers both earlier and later than Spenser, including those of the nineteenth century (e.g., Dickens or Hawthorne) or of the twentieth (e.g., Ionesco or Beckett). But I want to emphasize that, while various larger connections will enrich our reading, the first responsibility of the course will be to Spenser=s and Milton=s epics, in themselves both aesthetically and culturally complex and engaging poems. We=ll read them closely and in detail. Work in the course will feature a presentation, a relatively short exploratory essay, and an essay of conference length (8-10 pages). The major text for Spenser The Faerie Queene, ed. A. C. Hamilton, 2nd edition (Longman, 2001); discounted copies are likely to be available locally and on-line. If the third edition is out before fall, either the second or third edition will serve. For Milton, I=ll order The Riverside Milton, ed. Roy Flannagan (Houghton Mifflin, 1998); again discounted copies are probably easily available. If you want to use another complete, recent, annotated edition of Paradise Lost, the class can cope with your doing so, but there are advantages to using The Riverside, since it includes extensive background material and other writings by Milton to which we=ll refer, and in the longer term it provides an essential item for a personal library. Please try to read or reread Book I of The Faerie Queene before class meets. Aside from this request, the most useful reading beforehand (not required!) would involve broad cultural background: e.g., for pleasure and profit, Edgar Wind, Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance, revised edition; Roy Strong, The Cult of Elizabeth or Frances A. Yates, Astrea: The Imperial Theme in the Sixteenth Century, Part II; or Philippa Berry, Of Chastity and Power, intro. and chap. 1. If you prefer to read theories of allegory, consider Carolynn Van Dyke=s Fiction of Truth, introduction and Part I; or perhaps dipping into Gordon Teskey=s Allegory and Violence, or Mendele Ann Treip=s Allegorical Poetics and Epic. Every year, I receive a few requests beforehand for suggested readings; I offer these in this spirit."

The emergence and/or reconception of a wide range of core sites for ongoing inquiry\x97such as sentiment, the body, kinship, regionalist writing, the \x93sisterhood of reforms,\x94 spiritualism, consumerism, sexuality, diet, children\x92s literature and child study, domesticity, the rise of the social sciences, and many others\x97owe a debt, albeit one not always acknowledged, to the advent of feminist approaches. This course admits that debt and aims to survey the field of American literary and cultural studies from roughly 1800 through the early 20th century through the lens that it provides. It is thus aimed both at students hoping to work on American literature of this broad period, irrespective of critical orientation, as well as at those in other fields with an interest in the varying ways that feminist criticism has influenced the kinds of questions scholars ask. We will read both canonical authors whose work has been positioned anew by the approaches in question (such as Melville, Dickinson, Brockden Brown, Dreiser) as well as more recently rediscovered works that have either become central texts for scrutiny or might become so as a result of their contributions (such as Hannah Webster Foster's The Coquette, Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin, Harriet Jacobs\x92s Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Sarah Orne Jewett's Country of the Pointed Firs, Pauline Hopkins\x92s Contending Forces, Charlotte Perkins Gilman\x92s Herland). Alongside the literary texts, we will read a generous selection of influential recent criticism by such writers as Elizabeth Dillon, Lauren Berlant, Cindy Weinstein, Gillian Brown, Wai Chee Dimock, Bill Brown, Nancy Bentley, Claudia Tate, Rita Felski, James Livingston, and others. The primary work of the class will be reading and discussion. In addition, students will be expected to produce several short response papers, as well as a conference-length (10-12 pp.) essay at the end of the term."

In its evolution the genre has not only engaged the burgeoning power of technoscience and it has also become, as Brooks Landon and others have argued, a cultural force in its own right. As such it is a significant measure of our response to Darwinian evolutionism, space travel, nuclear power, computing, robotics and other technosciences that are indivisible from our perception of modern life. Thus the genre's persistent (often unexamined) determination of social as well as technological change is worth exploration. This seminar will recover science fiction's professional maturation in the intellectual and cultural ferment that marked the last half of the twentieth century. We will trace the genre\x92s social and aesthetic trajectory in its American and British registers, following a transatlantic conversation containing points of unanimity and difference. We will consider the reformation of the genre in the 1950s as a significant site of cold war thought and feeling; the counterpoint enacted between the genre\x92s public role as the voice of the Space Age and the \x93inner-space\x94 experiments of its radical \x93New Wave\x94 in the 1960s; the tremendous impact of second- wave feminism during the 1970s as hard science fiction is articulated as a generic core; and the rise of cyberpunk in the 1980s, its fostering of a new information-based, computer-mediated paradigm. We will also be concerned both with how the gender and race-based exclusions that shape the genre's dominant traditions have been resisted by those minority and women writers who otherwise work within the referential system of genre conventions. What is at stake, finally, is a recovery of the genre's satiric edge; the liberatory potential that empowered the political and literary experiments of the 1960s and the feminist and anti-racist formulations that followed. This seminar also engages current scholarship that examines the interchange between science and literature and their cultural/political relevance. Carl Freedman, Robert Scholes, Vivian Sobchak, Darko Suvin, Marleen Barr, and Samuel R. Delany are among the critics and scholars who will provide critical context and theoretical perspective for our work during the semester. Authors to be considered may include James Blish, Ursula K.

It will open with classic texts in the history of feminism from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries to the nineteen seventies. Here we will pay particular attention to Mary Wollstonecraft, Anna Julia Cooper, Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, Audre Lorde, Tillie Olsen, Alice Walker, and Adrienne Rich. Then we will read a cluster of feminist scholars attempting to redefine literary history and the canon: Elaine Showalter, Annette Kolodny, Jane Tompkins, Barbara Christian. With a little help from intellectual historians, we will look at the work of influential feminist thinkers in psychology and anthropology like Nancy Chodorow and Gayle Rubin as well as such French theorists as H\xE9l\xE8ne Cixous and Luce Irigaray. Then we will approach the impact of post-structuralism on American feminism through short texts by Judith Butler, Donna Haraway, and bell hooks. In the second half of the course, we will focus on recent scholarship on gender in critical race, post-colonial, sexuality, trauma, and cultural studies. In an effort to see where feminist theory and criticism is going, we will probably conclude by drawing on some materials on electronic reserve. Students will be asked to produce two one-page response statements to help generate discussion. These should be made available on Oncourse twenty-four hours before the pertinent class session. There are also two longer required essays, each approximately 10-12 pages long. In the first paper, students will be asked to consider the earlier history of feminist criticism and theory by dealing with a figure prominent before the nineteen seventies. In the second paper, students will be encouraged to examine one significant aspect of the impact of feminist theory and criticism on their future area of expertise.

In doing so, the course will focus both on dramatic form and in the representation of historical events. It will begin in the later 19th century by isolating two popular dramatic forms-- melodrama and social realism--and then move through those forms associated with the founding of Ireland's Abbey Theatre and with the contemporary stage: realism, the Irish peasant play, absurdism, the Neo-Brechtian materialist theatre, and Irish \"Troubles\" drama, which inevitably raises postcolonial issues. Particular attention will be paid to the plays of Bernard Shaw, J.M. Synge, Sean O'Casey, Samuel Beckett, Harold Pinter, Edward Bond, Brian Friel, Marina Carr, Martin McDonagh, and Marie Jones. At times, relevant theoretical or critical essays will accompany plays by these writers. We will also discuss academic writing directly in this course, talking about such matters as abstracts, conference papers, and the construction of scholarly arguments. Indeed, one week early in the term will be devoted solely to such topics. Assigned writing for the course includes the composition of an 8-10 page essay suitable for presentation at a conference (preceded by a 1-page abstract)and a revision and/or brief expansion of the paper as a final assignment.

Students can take either semester, or sign up for both. We will divide the class focus more or less chronologically, moving in the fall from the era of the American Revolution and the rise of antislavery discourse, through the era of the Napoleanic wars and England\x92s second conflict with their former colony (called the War of 1812 in the U.S.). So, say 1776-1815. (The second semester will move enough forward in time to consider the \x93late\x94 Romanticism represented by antebellum American writers). The luxury of having a full year, and two of us, means that we can aspire both to provide a survey of what has been achieved over the past ten to fifteen years with a trans-Atlantic perspective, as well as highlight some of the emerging archival opportunities and methodological innovations in the field. Although we are trained in British and American literature and culture, respectively, we hope to incorporate other Anglophone Atlantic culture hearths. We are still some way from fixing a reading list, but we know we will be looking past (but not ignoring) the vast network of literary influences of the \x93Emerson read Carlyle\x94 variety, to consider the ways in which forces larger than literary culture\x97transformations in spatial experience, geopolitical upheavals like war or revolution or imperial expansion, changes in the materialities of communication, manners and laws of possession and self-possession\x97impinge upon, form and deform, the expressive cultures of the Romantic Atlantic. We are especially interested, in other words, in approaches that change what we take to be our primary objects of analysis, or the kind of arguments we can make. We have received a curricular development grant from IU that will allow us to bring in several prominent scholars in the field, who will be able both to reflect on what scholarship in this field has accomplished, and where it might go next. Each speaker will give a public lecture and hold a seminar meeting with the class. We conceive of this class as a laboratory for advanced graduate work. We would like to experiment with novel ways of approaching collective and individual scholarship, as well as reconfigurations of concepts of expertise and critical practice. While we are still thinking through requirements\x97and would be happy to receive suggestions from interested students, or merely inquiries\x97we do expect to ask students to engage in some independent investigation of sources and archives not covered by our joint readings, as well as some work for oral presentation."

The field has seen a recent turn, or return, to religion in connection with philosophy, questions of civil society, and the cultural politics of imperialism, among other things. This course seeks to recapitulate some of these developments as a basis for discussion, from which students may formulate historically and theoretically informed approaches to the period\x92s literary and dramatic texts. The course will be organized around two foci: (1) literary engagements with political theologies (how do writers intervene in post-Reformation issues of sovereignty, citizenship, sainthood?); (2) textual encounters with the Other/others (how do genres devise responsibilities to the divine interpellation and to religious others, namely, Ireland and Islam?). The overall objective is to create a conversation that locates these texts between religion and philosophy in addressing concerns relevant to early modern England as well as today. Primary texts may include: Margaret Cavendish\x92s Blazing World (selections) and The Religious; Christopher Marlowe\x92s Tamburlaine; Milton\x92s Paradise Lost (selections) and Samson Agonistes; Shakespeare\x92s Measure for Measure and Othello; Spenser\x92s A View of the Present State of Ireland and Mutalibitie Cantos; Anna Trapnel\x92s The Cry of a Stone; a Turk play.

Evidence for this centrality abounds: Hume\x92s derivation of moral principles from sentiment rather than reason; the emergence of the discourse of aesthetics, in Burke and elsewhere, grounding complex judgments of value in sensations of pain and pleasure; Adam Smith\x92s model of sympathetic moral feeling; the emerging literature of sensibility; and, later still, Wordsworth\x92s elevation of feeling over action in poetry. The stakes of feeling and the questions raised by it, in these discourses and elsewhere, are considerable: Can feeling serve as the basis for social and national cohesion, at a time when traditional grounds for collective identity were beginning to erode? Or, conversely, is feeling (as \x93enthusiasm,\x94 for instance) a threat to social stability? Does feeling allow for special access to the experience of others or is it, in naming what is most one\x92s own, essentially isolating? More fundamentally still, is feeling owned by the subject or a contagion passing promiscuously from person to person? We\x92ll survey the key philosophical discussions of feeling mentioned above, and then turn to literary treatments of the topic, including examples of the literature of sensibility, in both prose and verse, but also ranging beyond it. My efforts to think through this topic according to separate emotions have seemed somewhat strained, but suffice it to say that we\x92ll touch on (at least) pity, anger, terror, desire and nostalgia (something for everyone). For novels, I have in mind Henry Mackenzie\x92s The Man of Feeling, Mary Hays\x92 Memoirs of Emma Courtney, Matthew Lewis\x92s The Monk, William Godwin\x92s Fleetwood, or the New Man of Feeling, Jane Austen\x92s Sense and Sensibility and Walter Scott\x92s Guy Mannering. We\x92ll also look at Joanna Baillie\x92s project of \x93Plays on the Passions,\x94 including her Introductory Discourse on the Passions, and De Quincey\x92s aesthetisizing of terror in the Essays \x93On Murder Considered as one of the Fine Arts.\x94 I also want to consider the relation between some sensibility poets (the Della Cruscan group, for instance) and the more canonical project regarding feeling in Wordsworth and Coleridge, which will lead us to think about connections between feeling and mood, as well as those between the Wordsworthean categories of \x93gross and violent stimulation\x94 (to be avoided) and the \x93spontaneous overflow of powerful feeling\x94 (to be sought). Critics who will accompany us in our discussions include Adela Pinch, Thomas Pfau, Jerome McGann, Jon Mee, Claudia Johnson, Charles Altieri and David Marshall.

For the British, imperial expansion was accompanied and consolidated by the spread of the English language and the inculcation of British cultural values through education. Colonial educational policies, however, became both politically and culturally double-edged. At the political level, they would result in the cultivation of a native clerical class to serve the Empire, and, simultaneously, the dissemination of bourgeois democratic ideals among the native, educated elite. Inspired by these ideals, this elite would emerge as the leadership of anti-colonial movements. At the cultural level, colonialism would have a profound impact on English literature, introducing semantic systems and epistemologies that have radically reshaped the novel. This course will investigate the emergence and use of post-colonial theory as a primary intellectual framework through which to analyze colonial relationships and their political and cultural legacies. We will begin by reading foundational texts in the field including Benedict Anderson\x92s Imagined Communities, Aime Cesaire\x92s Discourse on Colonialism, Frantz Fanon\x92s The Wretched of the Earth, and Edward Said\x92s Orientalism. We will be concerned with how these texts disclose the ideological and discursive operations of Empire and anti-colonial nationalism. In particular, we will ask what kind of relationship these works posit between institutions and the intellectual. Throughout the course, we will consider some of the seminal issues which define the history of post-colonial studies, such as the role of women in national liberation struggles, the ways that prison serves as an alternative site of learning, the utility of dependency theory for understanding global disparities of wealth, the status of the subaltern and the challenges of archiving subaltern consciousness, and the relationship between colonialism and globalization. Near the end of the course, we will turn to the institutionalization of post-colonial studies and question to what extent it has been driven by identity politics and the structure of global capitalism. Finally, we will examine how the emphasis on South Asia in the field has had an impact on its ability to develop models for understanding colonialism in other geopolitical sites. Students should expect to write weekly electronic journals, take an active role in classroom discussion, and write a twenty-page seminar paper. In addition, students will be required to attend one or two lectures by visiting speakers outside of class. A tentative list of readings includes: Aijaz Ahmad, In Theory: Classes, Nations, Literatures. Eqbal Ahmed, Confronting Empire. Benedict Anderson, Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism. Aime Cesaire, Discourse on Colonialism. Cynthia Enloe, The Curious Feminist: Searching for Women in a New Age of Empire. Frantz Fanon, The Wretched of the Earth (Richard Philcox\x92s translation) Robert Foster, Materializing the Nation, Commodities, Consumption, and Media in Papua New Guinea. Ranajit Guha and Gayatri Spivak\x92s edited collection, Selected Subaltern Studies Harry Harootunian, The Empire\x92s New Clothes: Paradigm Lost, and Regained Anne McClintock, Aamir Mufti, Ella Shohat editors, Dangerous Liaisons, Gender, Nation, and Postcolonial Perspectives. Edward Said, Orientalism. E. San Juan Jr.\x92s Beyond Post-Colonial Theory I will also assemble a packet of articles on the institutionalization of post-colonial studies and the relationship between colonialism and globalization."

What are the conditioning pressures, social and psychological, that situate individuals within one identity while instilling, as a defining feature of that identity, an identification with--often a longing for--other identities, apparently unattainable? How do these pressures also shape literary form and our reading experience? Counterfactuals have been of great interest recently to historians, philosophers of history, metaphysicians, and logicians. The deep history of the topic stretches back at least to Leibniz and his discussion of possible worlds, and it has recently been energized by the writing of David Lewis and Niall Ferguson; in these regions of thinking, it bears on questions of causation with special force. We will glance down these historiographical, metaphysical, and logical paths\x97especially if there is student interest\x97but our main focus will be on the questions raised above about individual lives. Our reading and conversations will intersect with recent work on literature and affect; on ethics and literature; and on narrative form in history. I imagine us reading fiction and essays by Henry and William James, Charles Dickens, Charles Lamb, and Phillip Roth; scholarship by Frances Ferguson, Tilottema Rajan, and William Galperin as well as selections from a forthcoming issue of Representations devoted to the topic. My own work so far on this has been in the nineteenth century, and I think there are strong reasons (historical and formal) why counterfactuals would be specially prominent during that time. But I am eager to learn about the counterfactual in other periods, and would welcome students of life writing, narratologists, and theorists of various stripes as well as specialists in other historical moments. Please drop me a note (at ahmiller@indiana.edu)if you have questions."

    :description: W131 is a course in academic writing that attempts to integrate critical reading, thinking, and writing about phenomena and issues in our culture. Rather than practicing a set of discrete skills or often unrelated modes of discourse, the course aims to build sequentially on students' ability to read both written and cultural texts closely and critically and to analyze those texts in ways that also engage and problematize students' own experience, the perspectives of "experts," and the world they live in. W131 aims to show students how the use of sources, agreement/disagreement, and personal response can be made to serve independent, purposeful, and well-supported analytical writing. In summary, the course offers instructions and practice in the reading, writing, and critical thinking skills required in college. Emphasis is on written assignments that require synthesis, analysis, and argument based on sources.

Absolutely nothing, or something too important to overlook? How should war be represented in movies, on the news, in video games, in novels? Who has the right to talk about war? Is it really true that the first casualty of war is truth? Does war demand that those who participate in it also attempt to represent it to non-participants? Is this demand the real responsibility of war? We will tackle these (and other) questions in this course by examining representations of war in a variety of media\x97from the film 300 and Art Spiegelman\x92s graphic novel Maus to the famous flag-raising photo at Iwo Jima and the World War II- inspired video game series Call of Duty. Throughout the course\x97which students should note is an academic writing skills course above all else\x97we will keep in mind two questions: Can the reality of war ever be adequately represented? and What meaning can we find in representations of war? We will also discuss the phenomenon of propaganda, keeping in mind that one person\x92s truth is another person\x92s propaganda. Because war can be such a polarizing political, moral, and ethical topic, it poses quite a challenge to objectivity, which is an integral part of the critical and analytical reading, writing, and thinking skills this course teaches. Students who have strong feelings or opinions about war should note that while we will examine texts to which one often cannot help but react on a personal level, we will seek to analyze representations of war rather than engage in debates on the topic. Finally, despite the gripping nature of the course\x92s content, students should remember that this is a writing course designed to prepare freshmen for the rigors of writing in an academic setting. By grappling with the difficult questions of war, we will develop the strong reading, writing, and thinking skills necessary to answering those questions."

What would it mean to live forever? What does living forever have to do with living a so-called \x93good life\x94? In this composition course, the material for our practice in writing, reading, and critical thinking will come from a range of competing secular \x96 that is, non-religious \x96 constructions of what immortality might look like. We will not look extensively at religious ideas of immortality, but instead will primarily examine contemporary non- religious representations of immortality that exist alongside of the religious beliefs many people hold. While our chief focus will be representations of immortality from our own time, we will also consider a handful of texts from other moments in history in order to provide a framework for understanding the shifting social and cultural forces that shape people\x92s view of immortality. Sub-topics of the course will include scientific discussions of immortality, supernatural constructions of immortal figures, popular culture representations of fame as immortality, and discourses of memorialization. Our readings will include a range of articles, short stories, and book excerpts, and we will also examine cultural artifacts like films and internet media. Our inquiry in this class will be guided by the following question: What can the various competing secular constructions of immortality tell us about how communities of living people envision their responsibilities to one another, and how do these imagined possibilities for immortality suggest individuals should live, in order to live a good life? While pursuing this inquiry question, we will focus continuously on developing the core skills in critical reading, critical thinking, and analytical writing that are the building blocks of college success in any discipline."

In the past few years, screenplays adapted from graphic novels have made for highly successful films. Examples include Sin City, V for Vendetta, Batman Begins, and 300. It is typical for these films to include some or all of the following elements: extreme violence, torture, secret prisons, terrorism, and government conspiracy. The protagonists of these films are most often male antiheroes who have either been outcast by society or have voluntarily entered into a life of crime. We will undertake a semester-long regimen of reading and writing in which we will consider this interesting cultural phenomenon from a wide range of perspectives. The graphic novels, films, and secondary essays watched and read in this class will provide the stimulus for a series of analytical inquiry papers.

Each unit of this classes will practice the vital skills and stages in the process of writing a research-based term paper for college classes, culminating in just such a research project for this class. As a vehicle for achieving this goal, this class will investigate a history and evolution of comic book superheroes throughout the twentieth century that culminates in the decidedly anti-heroic heroes of contemporary graphic novels. We will begin by looking at the earliest superheroes of the \x93Golden Age\x94 of comics in the original Superman, The Bat-Man, and Wonder Woman comic books of the 1930s and 40s. Next we\x92ll look at how the social politics of the superhero evolve to reflect\x97and influence\x97social change during the \x93Silver Age\x94 of comics in the 1960s and 70s, driven by Stan Lee\x92s work in Spider-Man and original The X-Men as well as the reinvention of The X-Men in the mid-1970s, introducing most characters familiar to us today (perhaps most notably Wolverine). We\x92ll look at the relationship between a more socially conscious superhero and these less simplistically wholesome, often more violent superheroes. We\x92ll end the class by investigating how these more violent superheroes transform into the graphically violent anti-superheroes written for \x93mature readers\x94 in the modern graphic novels Batman: The Dark Knight Returns by Frank Miller (who also wrote Sin City and The 300) and Watchmen, created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons (the team also responsible for V for Vendetta). The appearance of these two works in 1986 forever changed the idea of the superhero\x97and the comic book industry as a whole. Our final unit in the class will consider how they draw on the tradition of the comic book superhero they are trying to destroy in order to understand what this revolution in popular literature implies about the culture that both derides comic books and consumes them in massive numbers."

But what do they look like and how do we interpret them? While we constantly read other people's emotions whenever we listen to music, watch movies, or look at pictures in magazines--we rarely stop to ask how we understand concepts such as \"happiness\" or \"sadness\" in the first place. Are feelings always \"pure\" expressions of internal states, or can they be artificial or performed? Do we turn off our emotions to cope with cinematic violence? If so, how do we become desensitized? Are sentiments always individual and private, or can they be social and political? Who decides? And finally, what strategies do artists, directors, advertisers, photographers and producers use to capture or display the complexities of inner life? These are just a few of the questions we will address in this composition course, which is designed to help students refine the reading, writing, and thinking skills they will need to do college- level work. Seeking to re-contextualize contemporary representations of feelings, both historically and culturally, we will think analytically and imaginatively about how and why we feel in the ways we do. Although emotional displays--of affection, of anger, of bliss--parade around like common sense in popular media, a careful consideration of how advertisements, fashion, song lyrics, music videos, and film create, manipulate, elevate, police, and custom design feelings will show just how scripted \"spontaneous\" responses can be. This course offers a nuanced approach to reevaluating the emotional aesthetics prevalent in popular culture by rethinking-on a fundamental level-how we express and communicate internal psychological states to the outside world. Above all, W170 is an intensive writing class."

Intended for students with prior background and familiarity with contemporary literature and fictional devices, this course will be largely conducted as a workshop in which students\x92 own writing will be the subject of discussion. (Note: Introduction to Fiction Writing is a prerequisite for taking this class.) A basic understanding of the elements of fiction (narration/dramatization/flashback, description, dialogue, and point- of-view) will be assumed, though we will cover these matters on a more sophisticated level than in English 381A. Moreover, we will focus on the more difficult tasks of producing publishable quality work. Issues of consistency of voice and tone, freshness of style and originality, as well as aesthetic and audience, will be discussed and emphasized through writing exercises and assigned readings. We will divide our time between your work and that of professional writers. I expect many issues will arise including, for example, the idea of place and how it affects characters\x92 lives, as well as the actions, diction, tone, and ultimately the shape of fictional narratives. Through close reading and writing you\x92ll be asked to answer questions such as: What is place and how is it achieved? How has narrative design evolved and what is our current concept of \x93story\x94? We can expect that many other related questions and topics will arise and you are encouraged to bring in craft essays or supporting materials for exploration. Students will be expected to bring in their new original fiction on a regular basis\x97at least two original short stories to be workshopped by your peers. Participation is a must, and students should be willing to share their own work, listen to the work of others, and both accept and provide insightful, judiciously offered commentary about each other\x92s work. At the end of the semester you\x92ll be expected to turn in a portfolio of your work, including your reading journal, both short stories and the comments your peers provided, a substantial revision of one story, a process note, and a 5-10 page critical essay evaluating your literary technique. The focus of this workshop should be on process and discovery, and for the experience to be satisfying, you must be willing to invest yourself, learn from others, reinforce your own fictional voice/identity, and in some cases grow beyond any misguided preconceptions you have about what it means to create meaningful fiction. I urge you to look closely at the requirements described and think about whether this is really the course you want, and also whether you have the time and energy to devote to this class. Students interested in this class should promptly submit 15-20 pages of fiction, together with a list of other creative writing classes they have taken and pertinent biographical information about themselves, to my mailbox in BH442.

We\x92ll consider these questions through a series of activities both large and small. In class sessions, we will focus mostly on photographs, films, and paintings. The major writing assignments will consist of three papers, each approximately four pages long. You will have various options for their topics, including the opportunity to study areas of the visual arts not dealt with in class (e.g., posters, video, sculpture, memorials, Web sites)."

I have designed this class to appeal to fiction writers, poets, and creative nonfiction writers alike, and hope we end up with a nice mix. Think Joseph Cornell boxes and dreamscapes; think imp of the perverse and \x93figure in the carpet\x94; think masked balls and magic; think scrimshaw and cameos; think \x93undulations of reverie\x94 (Baudelaire). For me, prose poems and flash prose (fiction and CNF) are complex, intricate forms that expand as much as they distill. Don\x92t let the \x93small size\x94 fool you. They\x92re hard to write! Expect to read various practitioners of the above forms (both contemporary and \x93old\x94), with a little criticism thrown in to shake things up, and to learn just a bit about the history of and variations on the forms. We will consider the too-numerous-to-count dimensions of and permutations on what makes us want to call something a prose poem and not a short fiction and v.v.; and we\x92ll take as our focus concerns about lyricism, narrative line and/or \x93no lines,\x94 music, image, metaphor, language, slice of life/vignette versus distillation, etc. Expect to write and share work in class, both scheduled and impromptu. We will take a more organic alternative to \x93traditional workshops\x94 that I hope will allow for both formal and informal conversations, so come with a flexible outlook. You can count on a schedule of regular, weekly writing assignments that will culminate in a final portfolio of revised pieces (you will be asked to present a combo of \x93forms\x94 tailored to your own interests, and a short critical piece of your choice produced over the semester). You will be encouraged to experiment with method, form, and vision (collaboration, more prose than poem, more poem than prose, persona, surrealism, \x93found,\x94 \x93collage,\x94 \x93translation,\x94 mini-memoir, etc.), and to work against your own strengths. Other class requirements will include the following: occasionally- scheduled, thoughtful, formal critiques of peer work; full and substantive participation in each class session; out loud reading of your work (sometimes on a schedule, sometimes not); a couple of short response papers on outside readings; and a willingness to try new things and take some chances. And even if you never write another prose poem or short prose piece again (as if you could resist!), the point of this class is to open doors to the unexpected, and perhaps help shed more light on the kind of writer you are becoming. A number of literary magazines are now devoted to these forms, so there is a practical side to this class, as well."

How do the arts contribute to our understanding of these events? How have the arts framed, structured, altered, and shaped our cognition of mortality? It is these questions and many more that this course will engage. Among the topics we will examine are the Black Death of 1348, Torture and Martyrdom, Images of War and Personifications of Death. We will analyze primarily art and literature of Europe, including paintings by Jacques Louis David, Hans Baldung Grien, Peter Breugel, Albrecht Durer, Rubens, and Picasso; readings will include short selections from Sophocles, Boccaccio, Edgar Allen Poe, Kafka and Camus. To complement these artists and authors, we will also investigate a few films, such as Twelve Monkeys. I look forward to seeing you in class!

The readings and course lectures will combine the study of the major monuments of classical art with an examination of archaeological methods and practices, both past and present. We will both examine the objectives of archaeological research and discuss how archaeologists interpret and reconstruct the past from excavated artifacts. We will also explore the works of art within their broader historical and social context, with a focus on the relationship between art and religion, politics social identity and status, trade and the economy, and everyday life. Contemporary issues in archaeology, particularly archaeological ethics (including questions of repatriation and the impact of the illegal trade in antiquities), will also be addressed."

We will attempt to define and analyze the mechanisms of irony, satire, parody, slapstick, whimsy, and wit, explore the realms of cuteness and the grotesque, and survey the borderlines where humor shades into disgust and fear.

From multiple areas of specialization (for example: modern, American, contemporary, African, Folk art, Poster art, graphic design, and even video), we will examine artists and art movements that explore issues we now recognize as pertinent to modern ecological movements and concerns. Seminar participants will select specific topics from their own areas of interest and begin research. As the semester progresses we will discuss the issues and problems that arise from this research, and consider how to create a web site that effectively presents everyone\x92s research findings. Research papers can be submitted in the form of text & image PowerPoint presentations. Why Offer This Class? These days it is more important than ever before to assert the relevance of the arts and humanities. Too often practical value and credibility are assigned to the sciences and professional schools, while arts and humanities are viewed JUST as cultural enrichment and entertainment. Far too many people do not take art (and art history) seriously as enterprises that examine key issues in people\x92s lives and critically explore the ways individuals and societies fit into the world. Let\x92s put teeth in art history and help give art back its clout. Possible Areas of interest include: earth works art that explores nature\x92s diversity or complexity Architecture that is environment-friendly art that promotes recycling Landscape as awareness (even Christo ?) Art exploring concepts of \x93Conquering Nature\x94 Art attacking waste Art that explores the value of nature art that critiques the industrial revolution, pollution, or the destruction of the environment"

    :description: "Picasso\x92s name is almost synonymous with 20th-century art. His paintings are sought after by museums and collectors; his work commands multi-million dollar princes; he has even been played on screen by Anthony Hopkins. In this class we will examine various periods of Picasso\x92s long and extremely productive career, concentrating within each period on a few key works. Although Picasso\x92s style changed radically from one period to the next, there are on-going themes that connect the different phases of his art. Among these are his persistent use of images from art of the past, his mythologizing of women, his alternation between \x93high\x94 and \x93low\x94 art, and his willingness to both maintain and attack the classical ideal of beauty. These issues and others will offer continuity over the course of the semester. (P: FINA A101 or A102, or permission of instructor)"

    :description: "F100 Fundamental Studio Drawing This is a general description based on an academic year semester. It is intended as a guide. Your instructor will provide you with specific course requirements. F100 Drawing is an introductory course that provides students a free hand linear approach to pictorial representation. Various graphic media, methods, and skills define \x93form\x94 and \x93personal\x94 geometric and expressive studies from nature, constructed objects, and imaginary sources. Initially, the curriculum emphasized geometrical line principles that develop hand-eye coordination and a visual awareness for the interpretation of a two-dimensional image. This entails visual measuring, isometric and perspective constructions, reflection principles, optical illusions, and dimensional representations of simple volumetric objects. Graphite pencils are used to create clear and exact line and shape forms having specific proportional limitations. These studies introduce visual concepts that underlie and are preparatory to a subsequent and more personally expressive free-hand drawing discipline. Line and shaded (value color) relationships are studied in unified compositions and offer the student a more complex interpretation of physical form and reflected light. Through the course \x93formal\x94 analytic and \x93free\x94 intuitive approaches combine a conscious, deliberate, skills control with personal investigations of ideas manifesting the drawing act. Seeing/perceiving and thinking/conceiving through drawing reveals to each student a personal history of visual experience that is continually revised. And although various studies may be defined by different degrees of material and/or conceptual limitations, the visual representation can never constitute a definitive application of ideas. The intention and clarity of each drawing can be questioned and only suggests a continuing visual potential. Search and discovery practice that is progressively self-defining reveals adventurous and independent activity while increasing the individual\x92s sensitivity and visual awareness. Drawing from life in itself is a definition of continual change, of self, and self in relation to a larger world context. The goals of the course are to develop through experience, by trial and error, the student\x92s visual imagination and understanding. A lab fee is charged.

Taking an ethnomusicological perspective, we will explore music as a complex cultural expression, intensely invested with social, artistic, economic and political meanings. Music, this course will show, is more than mere entertainment, or simply notes on a printed page; rather, understanding music helps us gain insight into the people who create and express it. How is it that the same musical sounds performed in one context can convey varied meanings to different people? Nuanced interpretations of music often require us to investigate it in terms of race, gender, class, and other criteria. Is music then a universal language? F111 explores this pervasive concept. Through the rich and textured analysis of audio and video recordings, as well as carefully selected reading materials and field experiences, students will develop a greater understanding of how they use sound to make meaning in their own lives. They will also learn how others both near and far use music to craft their own senses of value, aesthetics and ideology"

    :description: "William Thoms conceived the term Folk Lore in 1846 to name the new discipline centered around the study of tradition. Since the advent of modern media and the World Wide Web, a more standardizing influence has evolved upon folk belief and other kinds of folklore. The new and related discipline of Popular Culture was developed to analyze the standardizing effects on these forms. The difference between folklore and popular culture is sometimes very difficult to determine, if such a distinction can really be made at all. Topics that interest scholars both in folklore and popular culture now appear regularly on film and video. This course will deal with a number of issues of folk belief and worldview reinforced, debated, propagated, and spread by film, video, the web, cinema, television, VCR, and DVD players in modern America. Moreover, the course will explore ways of critically viewing and examining folklore and popular culture in video and film. In spite of the powerful influence of science on contemporary worldview, many people still cling to beliefs others consider illogical and unreasonable. Tools for critical thinking will be explored in readings and discussions. A major goal of this class will be to assist students to develop skills for thinking critically about a wide variety of folk belief common in our times. As this course has progressed from one semester to the next, students themselves have chosen over half the topics potentially covered in the course. From this list, students choose 10 topics to be thoroughly investigated during the semester in both videos and class debates. Those topics include: Aids Conspiracy Theories Martin Luther King Assassination Alien Abductions Conspiracy Theories Ark of the Covenant Marilyn Monroe Assassination Atlantis Conspiracy Theories Bermuda Triangle Moon Landing Hoax Conspiracy Theories Bigfoot Near Death Experience Chupacabra 9/11 Conspiracy Theories Crop Circles Nostradamus Prophesies Doomsday Prophesies Philadelphia Experiment Exorcism Princess Diana Assassination Garden of Eden Conspiracy Theories Ghosts Psychics Holy Grail (cup) Roswell UFO Crash Hole Grail (Da Vinci Code) Search for Holy relics Human Cloning Search for Noah\x92s Ark JFK Assassination Conspiracy Theories Shroud of Turin Jack the Ripper Spontaneous Human Combustion Lincoln Assassination Conspiracy Theories Stigmata Loch Ness (and other Lake Monsters) UFOs Lost Tribes of Israel Yeti (Abominable Snowman) If the Truth is out there, perhaps you will find it in this course."

    :description: "This course focuses on the embodied cultural experiences and expressions of women as viewed from an ethnographic perspective. It is the goal of this course to explore women\x92s cultural experience (mainly in the U.S. and West Africa), by focusing on the ways women transform their experiences and make meaning in their lives through art, ritual, performance, narrative and other expressive forms. This course also seeks to examine the gender systems in various cultural contexts that influence and shape (and sometimes constrain), the way that individual women make meaning. We will be looking in depth at some of our own gender systems and the institutions through which these are spread, in order to explore some of the ways our cultural constructions of gender affect the way we experience being women living inside particular bodies. Some of the readings we will be doing will be theoretical while the bulk of the material will come from the field experiences and writings of various women ethnographers and women artists. Coursework for the class includes several mini-papers, a journal, and a in-depth fieldwork project."

    :credit: "394"
    :description: "Meets with E394. This course focuses on forms of informal communication as the means by which beliefs, stereotypes, attitudes, values, and prejudices are transmitted through society. We will examine many stories (narratives, jokes, etc.) that people tell and beliefs people hold about themselves, other people, and also about events. Using texts, movies, and music, we will attempt to understand the ways in which ideas develop about difference and sameness, about one's own experiences and that of others. These ideas which sometimes develop into prejudices, at other times into conspiracy theories, and even into tolerance and understanding in some instances, are encapsulated in the discourses of everyday life. Students will write papers that total at least 5000 words. Some of these will be responses to readings or videos, while others will involve reporting on observations or personal experience that relate to ideas of sameness and difference. Students will devote considerable time to developing writing skills, including rewriting selected essays and learning to critique one's own writing. The class will work in groups quite often to discuss ideas and also to develop writing skills. The final writing project will be a study and analysis of discourse that the student has observed and recorded concerning the topics we discuss in class (difference and sameness, self and other, conspiracies and realities, humor and mimicry, etc.). The discourse and the situation in which it occurs must be located in the author's home life or campus life, but observations may be incorporated from readings and movies we have watched in the class.

This class analyzes the complex relationship between human beings and the material world they inhabit and create, in order to better comprehend the institution of the museum. An understanding of material culture helps us view how makers, users and viewers relate to objects in homes, commercial establishments and eventually, in museums. One of the principle aims of this course is to look at the museology of everyday life, in other words, how the general museum principles of collection, preservation and exhibition are found in all the environments we occupy. We will of course focus the class on the museum itself, looking at museums as institutions in a process of continual negotiation of different objectives: object collection and research, object preservation, exhibition, education, and entertainment. Through readings and lectures, we will be introduced to different kinds of museums, including art, ethnographic, historic, as well as the museums of particular interest to folklorists, namely outdoor museums, folk art museums, and folk festivals. The aim of this course is three-fold: to read and discuss critically the literature on material culture and museology, to analyze local museum exhibitions, and to produce a creative proposal of an exhibition. The assignments for the class include museum visits and exhibition reviews, as well as a final project consisting of an exhibition proposal, complete with sample labels, exhibit walk-through, list of all the objects, photos and other multi-media supporting materials, as well as related public programs and educational materials."

Explores past and current theories, methods, techniques, and tools used in notation and analysis of traditional music. Emphasis is placed on problem solving and project development. The musical traditions studied will sample a broad range of traditions from around the globe and encompass historical and recent time periods. Prerequisites: Major/minor in ethnomusicology or permission of the instructor. Knowledge of musical notation and demonstrated experience in music dictation (T113-114 or equivalent). Contents of Course: Transcription and analysis are fundamental processes in ethnomusicological research and scholarship. Through exploration and application of theories, methods, techniques, tools, and skill development in transcription and analysis, this course provides a foundation upon which students may become successful researchers and scholars in the field of ethnomusicology. Works of historical significance will be examined in relationship to current theories and questions about music; theoretical principles will be studied as bases for practical application; works of established scholars will serve as groundwork for the research interests of each student in the course. The musical traditions represented in the literature and recordings studied in this course will sample a broad range of traditions from around the globe, and encompass past and recent time periods. While work with music in this course is done outside of its cultural context, knowledge of context will consistently inform assumptions made and approaches used to transcribe and analyze music. The evolution of transcription and analysis in the field of ethnomusicology has been closely aligned with, and in large part driven by the evolution of audio and visual technology. Consequently, the study and use of audio and video technology is a major component of the course. The course covers the various formats on which sound and visual images are stored, and how technology can be used to extract, notate, analyze, and illustrate aural and visual elements of music performance. Technology training is done primarily in the lab sections of the course. Readings: The course draws from an extensive list of articles and books; some are required reading, while others are optional of reference works. Required readings range from one to two articles per week. No reading assignments are given during the last two weeks of class. Outline of Requirements: Daily preparation of reading assignments for discussion in class Short writing assignments Transcription and analysis assignments Two major assignments: Class symposium paper and presentation Individual research paper Work in assignments and individual projects in SAVAIL and other technology labs"

Course description and objectives: This is the capstone seminar for majors and minors in the Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology (students in other departments should contact the instructor for approval to enroll in the course). The course provides an opportunity for students 1) to consolidate and build upon knowledge learned through individual courses and experiences; 2) to apply that knowledge in a sustained project of significant intellectual and/or practical value to be completed this semester; and 3) to prepare for their futures. Students will complete a common core of readings on topics such basic concepts in folklore/ethnomusicology and techniques for research, writing, and other modes of presentation. The bulk of the semester's work, however, will be specific to each student's individual project and needs. Students also will complete a portfolio of their work to date, with an eye toward future educational and career plans. Class members will meet together in a seminar setting to discuss projects, portfolios, and relevant theories and methods. And they will work in collaboration to support and improve upon their work. As in all classes, the course will help students to continue to refine skills in communication, research, critical thinking, and scholarship--including research methods, conceptualization, evaluation and use of relevant sources, and writing. With an emphasis on the work of synthesis and reflection, the primary aim for F497 is for students to emerge from this course--and from their experience in the department and at IU--feeling competent in their chosen field and confident that the knowledge they have acquired can be transformed into worthwhile endeavors in the near and distant future."

Centered on the concerns of folklorists and ethnomusicologists, but open to students across the humanities and social sciences, this course will examine key theoretical perspectives used in the study of material culture. While some attention will be given to literatures and topics grounded in historical and archaeological methods, the course\x92s methodological center of gravity will be ethnographic and ethnological. We will read and critically examine a combination of classic and contemporary studies and will explore an array of theoretical perspectives not only on material culture per se, but also on the ways that social and cultural life are, according to various perspectives, reflected in, mediated by, fashioned through, recast via, or contested around, things and peoples\x92 relations with things. We will begin and conclude by considering the roots and fruits of the distinctive tradition of material culture studies associated with the Indiana University Department of Folklore and Ethnomusicology, but we will place our school of material culture studies, which is dominant in American folklore studies at-large, into dialogue with important older perspectives and with other contemporary ones that are increasingly influential in the wider field of material culture studies today."

This course examines some of the genres of folk narrative popular in American culture as well as current theories and analytical perspectives useful in carrying out research on these forms of expression. We will attend to both historically significant genres, such as the folktale and myth, and genres that are currently thriving, such as the urban legend, the personal narrative, and jokes. Also we will note that some narrative forms are often closely tied in the literature to specific culture groups\x97 for example, myths and Native American groups, rap-like \x93toasts\x94 and African American performers, and the Jack tales and Ozark or Appalachian storytellers. Because the topic of American folk narrative is richly inclusive, the course will be to some extent a survey, leaving deeper explorations of each genre or culture group for subsequent coursework or independent research. Consequently, one major requirement for the course will be a research proposal outlining a project that, when completed, would explore a significant question tied to one of the genres surveyed in the course. Additional requirements will include oral reports on research articles and written reading responses. Texts ordered for the course include: Abrahams, Roger. Deep Down in the Jungle Baker, Ronald L.

These include bluegrass, tex-mex, blues, polka, string band, shapenote, cajun, zydeco, mariachi, klezmer, gospel and steelband music. In addition, we will explore issues of ethnicity, style, revival, and commercialization. The goals of the course are threefold: to develop a familiarity with the diversity of American regional and ethnic musics, to understand the history of stylistic borrowing and innovation that has created these musics, and to examine the roles these musics play in the lives of the people who make it. No musical background is necessary. The course will use the textbook, Musics of Multicultural America and its accompanying CD. In addition, there will be supplementary readings and listening materials."

    :description: "In this seminar we explore systems of belief and practice implicated in traditional healing rituals in several regions of Latin America. This region of the world features indigenous native doctors of the Andes, African folk religion as conserved and refined in such places as Brazil and Cuba, as well as bot\xE1nicas, santer\xEDa, curanderos, and many other practices and practitioners operating at the boundary of medicine and religion. Our quest will be to assess the dynamic interplay linking myth, cosmos, and healing in these systems -- to see how ritual practices are grounded in mythic narratives and the cosmologies they sustain, and how myth and cosmos are activated to confer upon these practices an aura of coherency, legitimacy, and authority. We will attend to the art, artifacts, music, ritual speech, and other techniques of curing and healing, stressing their connection to enabling mythologies and cosmologies. Lastly, we will contemplate the probable fate of these traditional systems in this twilight of modernity, as they seemingly expand their scope of activity and yet are deeply transformed in the process."

This class analyzes the complex relationship between human beings and the material world they inhabit and create, in order to better comprehend the institution of the museum. An understanding of material culture helps us view how makers, users and viewers relate to objects in homes, commercial establishments and eventually, in museums. One of the principle aims of this course is to look at the museology of everyday life, in other words, how the general museum principles of collection, preservation and exhibition are found in all the environments we occupy. We will of course focus the class on the museum itself, looking at museums as institutions in a process of continual negotiation of different objectives: object collection and research, object preservation, exhibition, education, and entertainment. Through readings and lectures, we will be introduced to different kinds of museums, including art, ethnographic, historic, as well as the museums of particular interest to folklorists, namely outdoor museums, folk art museums, and folk festivals. The aim of this course is three-fold: to read and discuss critically the literature on material culture and museology, to analyze local museum exhibitions, and to produce a creative proposal of an exhibition. The assignments for the class include museum visits and exhibition reviews, as well as a final project consisting of an exhibition proposal, complete with sample labels, exhibit walk-through, list of all the objects, photos and other multi-media supporting materials, as well as related public programs and educational materials."

    :description: "\"Classics,\" whether ancient or modern, are writings that have taken on a status of perenniality--sometimes to the extent that one cannot envision a particular topic apart from its \"classic statement.\" The works considered in this course have all served as linchpins in cross-cultural imagination and epistemological theorizing. Our consideration of them will be from three angles: First, we will strive to understand the basic arguments (an endeavor with many surprises since such works are more often cited or alluded to than read). Second, the recent and contemporary consequences of such works for folkloristics will be explored, including processes of tradition and innovation in derivative theorizing (the instructor's contribution will be especially directed toward this concern). Thirdly, we will attempt to distinguish factors that contribute to a work's achieving classic status, and the role (positive or negative) of such status in shaping disciplines and research strategies. This course will be based on careful reading and critical discussion. A fair amount of oral presentation is expected; writing will be limited to short analytical essays. The following is a sampling of topics and readings: On Logic and Cognition: - Aristotle: Categories and Metaphysics Book G (the \"law of contradiction\") - Lucien Levy-Bruhl, Notebooks on Primitive Mentality - Marcel Mauss, The Gift - Eleanor Rosch, Cognition and Categorization On Magical Thought: - David Hume, An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding - James Frazer, The Golden Bough (excerpts) - Claude Levi-Strauss, \"The Science of the Concrete\" On Language and Cultural Relativism: - Benjamin Lee Whorf, Language, Thought, and Reality - Edward Sapir, \"Culture, Genuine and Spurious\" - Ferdinand de Saussure, Course in Linguistics On Science and The Scientific Revolution: - Lucretius, On the Nature of the Universe - Galileo, \"Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina\" - C.P.

Beginning with the 1550 debates over "Indian" humanity, and ranging to contemporary scholarship about and by Indigenous peoples, this course takes as its focus the intersections of writing, colonialism, violence, and historiography in the Americas. Students will explore the relationship between 16th century reasoning about race and post-millennial, Western, academic practices of writing history. The course will challenge students to develop a critical stance on the utility of post-colonial theories as such perspectives come to bear upon anthropological and historical studies of indigenous religiosity. Some of the regions considered include southwest Columbia, the Orinoco Delta in Venezuela, the Valley of Mexico and several examples throughout the U.S. southwest, plains, and northeast. Students will be expected to complete weekly response papers, three in-class presentations, and one final paper.

    :description: "Meets with E678/G751. If we take ritual to be the social act basic to humanity, as Rappaport argues, this formal event and the multiple related ritual genres (festival, carnival, drama, contests, pilgrimage, etc.), provide an arena for the exploration of the social response to contradiction. Rituals intensify and condense communication, creating an experimental technology, in the words of the Comaroffs, to affect the flow of power in the universe, to plumb the magicalities of modernity. The course will focus on the larger concept of ritual genres as performed in various locations. Using anthropological theories of ritual and power, the course will consider the production of ritual, the form itself, its discourse, and the actual performance. Selected studies will concentrate on the public context of ritual and festival, participation of specific populations, and the outcomes, planned and unplanned. Linking ritual to public culture, the course explores it as a response to contradiction in social and political life. We will consider the interaction of the ritual genres with politics, tourism, history, identity, gender, the state, religion. Examples will include rites of passage (traditional ones and newly created ones), historical celebrations enacting an event in history, occupational festivals, rituals of domination and rituals of resistance. Two papers will be required: one 10 page paper and one 20 page paper. Readings will be announced."

Explores past and current theories, methods, techniques, and tools used in notation and analysis of traditional music. Emphasis is placed on problem solving and project development. The musical traditions studied will sample a broad range of traditions from around the globe and encompass historical and recent time periods. Prerequisites: Major/minor in ethnomusicology or permission of the instructor. Knowledge of musical notation and demonstrated experience in music dictation (T113-114 or equivalent). Contents of Course: Transcription and analysis are fundamental processes in ethnomusicological research and scholarship. Through exploration and application of theories, methods, techniques, tools, and skill development in transcription and analysis, this course provides a foundation upon which students may become successful researchers and scholars in the field of ethnomusicology. Works of historical significance will be examined in relationship to current theories and questions about music; theoretical principles will be studied as bases for practical application; works of established scholars will serve as groundwork for the research interests of each student in the course. The musical traditions represented in the literature and recordings studied in this course will sample a broad range of traditions from around the globe, and encompass past and recent time periods. While work with music in this course is done outside of its cultural context, knowledge of context will consistently inform assumptions made and approaches used to transcribe and analyze music. The evolution of transcription and analysis in the field of ethnomusicology has been closely aligned with, and in large part driven by the evolution of audio and visual technology. Consequently, the study and use of audio and video technology is a major component of the course. The course covers the various formats on which sound and visual images are stored, and how technology can be used to extract, notate, analyze, and illustrate aural and visual elements of music performance. Technology training is done primarily in the lab sections of the course. Readings: The course draws from an extensive list of articles and books; some are required reading, while others are optional of reference works. Required readings range from one to two articles per week. No reading assignments are given during the last two weeks of class.

    :credit: "410"
    :description: "F410 will introduce students to the literature of the French Middle Ages. I have selected four different kinds of literature from short romance (Marie de France), chanson de geste (Chanson de Roland), the Arthurian romance of Chr\xE9ti\xE9n de Troyes, and an intellectual form of romance, Roman de la Rose. At the dawn of French vernacular writing, these works introduce students to medieval intellectual thought, society and social structure, questions of honor, duty, faith and the struggle between reason and the senses in man\x92s conduct. Marie de France explores the nature of love in her lais, stories from the European fold and classic tradition. Chr\xE9ti\xE9n\x92s romances reveal the superficialities and civilized traditions of the legendary Arthurian court as seen in the eyes of a twelfth-century writer. The Chanson de Roland expresses the heroic tradition of the chivalric age at a time when Europe was in the engaging in the great expedition known as the First Crusade. Finally the Roman de la Rose is the French counterpart to Dante\x92s Divina Commedia, a penetrating, intellectual romance that probes man\x92s hypocrisy and his struggle to persuade himself of his own destiny."

The perspective of the course is descriptive rather than theoretical in the sense that, although various theories of language and its relation to society will be discussed, facts presented in the course will not be intended to support a particular theory. The course will open with a discussion of the main applied linguistic products in our societies\x96dictionaries. Next there will be a sociolinguistically- oriented survey of the linguistic situation in France and in various Francophone regions, including a discussion of such relevant constructs as multilingualism and diglossia. The main part of the course will deal with various aspects of the structure of French: phonology, morphology, syntax, and pragmatics of French will be presented with emphasis on the spoken language and a coverage of social, stylistic, and geographical variation."

How does narrative literature, as it developed in the wake of the French Revolution, reflect and also construct subjectivity? What are the factors (spatial, political, technological, sexual, and social) that define the self in the first half of the 19th century? Through close readings of Romantic and Realist novels, as well as works by theorists such as Michel Foucault, Marc Aug\xE9, Roland Barthes, and Gilles Deleuze, we will examine how the modern subject is both framed by the text and resists definition.

    :description: "Topic: The Postcolonial Novel. In the words of Mikhail Bakhtin, the novel is the only literary genre (presumably, in the broad sense) to have arisen \x93since the book\x94 and is quintessentially modern. There has been consensus on this point, and it has meant that the new nations emerging from colonial empires had to \x93produce novels in order to certify their distinct and modern nationhood\x94 (Lynch and Warner, Cultural Institutions of the Novel). This seminar will consider the importance of the novels from the formerly colonized spaces, their common denominators of social justice and \x93writing back to the center\x94 (Ashcroft, et al.), and how they have affected our understanding of novels and literature more broadly from the late twentieth century to the present. We will reflect on the location of the novelist, the readership of such novels, and the usefulness of the category \x93postcolonial,\x94 what it enables and what it forecloses. We will do readings on the novel as a genre and on postcolonialism--from C\xE9saire and Fanon, Said and Jameson to Bhabha and Spivak, McClintock, Moretti, and Cassanova. Alongside the classics of postcolonialism we will examine other texts that may disrupt or challenge the category. We will read novelists representative of varied national and cultural spheres, such as Chinua Achebe (Nigeria), Miguel Asturias (Guatemala), Andr\xE9 Brink (South Africa), Assia Djebar (Algeria), Nuruddin Farah (Somalia), Kim Lefevre (Vietnam/France), Toni Morrison (U.S.), Herta Muller (Roumania), Ngugi wa Thiongo (Kenya), Ben Okri (Nigeria/Britain), Salman Rushdie (India/Britain), Simone Schwarz- Bart and Daniel Maximin (Guadeloupe/France)."

Issues related to language planning in pidgins and creoles will be discussed, including topics such as the elaboration of spelling systems and vocabulary expansion. We will have a close look at key structures in pidgins and creoles (e.g. TMA markers, serial verbs, bimorphemic interrogatives, predicate clefting, ideophones) and at the origins and development of such structures. This course is colisted with L636. Students enrolled in F675 will focus particularly on French-lexified pidgins or creoles, though data from English- and Portuguese-lexified creoles (among others) will also be examined in readings and class discussion.

This class focuses on works written in Italian but that cannot be classified as part of Italian literature according to the traditional national canon.

The goal of the class is that of reflecting upon literary categories that do not apply anymore (or have never applied) to specific sections of Italian literature that are better understood if de-nationalized and envisioned in a multicultural and multilingual context. Is it topics or languages that assimilate to a specific tradition? An Algerian author who writes in Italian belongs to a specific literary tradition? An Italian poets who writes in Italian but lives abroad, is an Italian author? A Swiss Italian writer is Swiss or Italian? or neither? We will study works that question the traditional lines of the Italian canon and suggest that rather than speaking of Italian literature, we should begin speaking of literature written in Italian."

Class work will include systematic vocabulary building designed to give students the tools they need to discuss literary types in German. Attention will be paid to points of advanced grammar and usage. Course readings and regular class discussions will focus on the formal and literary means by which authors from different times treat related motifs, themes, and ideas. All texts will be in German. German will also be used as the first language of discussion, but English will be available as needed. Prerequisites: Any student may enroll in G305 who has either completed G300 at IUB with a grade of C- or higher or achieved an official qualifying score on the IUB German Placement Test (administered by the IUB Bureau of Evaluation Services and Testing), or on another standardized proficiency test. Completion of G330, however, is strongly recommended.

    :description: "Topic: Nietzsche, Weber, Freud Purpose: One often hears the complaint that we live in an age in which \x93anything goes,\x94 an age of relativism marked by the loss of religious belief, transcendent meaning, and moral standards \x96 in short, a time of nihilism. In response, people talk of \x93values\x94 and \x93norms,\x94 by which they mean standards that ought to guide our behavior, even if we cannot determine or agree on where these standards come from \x96 God? Tradition? Reason? These are neither new complaints nor new solutions, but represent rather a continuation of centuries-old debates. In this course we will look at three influential thinkers from German-speaking Europe of the late 19th and early 20th centuries \x96 Friedrich Nietzsche, Max Weber, and Sigmund Freud \x96 who struggled to come to terms with a modernity that no longer provided tried and true guidelines for how to live. Each thinker presents us with a description of modern life in which the individual is beset by a variety of seemingly irresolvable moral and existential conflicts. Faced with these mutually exclusive obligations and desires, the modern man or woman has only one duty: choose, and live with the consequences of one\x92s choice. The purpose of the course is to understand the problems the three thinkers addressed, but certainly not to solve them. We wish to understand the modern world as seen through their writings and compare their analyses with the way we see our place in the world at the beginning of the 21st century. Paradoxically, though the aim of this course is \x93increased knowledge,\x94 the presupposition underlying that aim assumes that the initial effects of such increased knowledge will cause confusion, doubt, and self-reflection. Or, at the very least, intellectual excitement. Texts: Books: Freud: Civilization and Its Discontents The Future of an Illusion Nietzsche: The Genealogy of Morals The Will to Power Weber: The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism The Vocation Lectures E-reserves: Nietzsche: \x93God is Dead\x94 Weber: \x93Religious Rejections of the World\x94 \x93The Meaning of \x91Ethical Neutrality\x92 in Sociology and Economics\x94 (selection) \x93\x91Objectivity\x92 in Social Science and Social Policy\x94 (selection)"

We will study short texts, films, and paintings in chronological order, observe changes in style and ideas in order to gain an overview as well as deeper insights into German culture while improving our language skills along the way. The course is thus the ideal preparation for more advanced levels of learning in the field of German. It hopes to instill you with enthusiasm for a language that has immense expressive power. At the end of the course, you should be able to read German literary texts fluently and express critical views and ideas eloquently in oral and written German. We will review Grammar and introduce basic tools for the analysis of texts while exploring the cultural landscape of German-speaking countries.

    :description: "Counts toward COAS Distribution Requirement in NMMC/Mathematical Sciences and Cognition or Natural Sciences and Mathematics The language of instruction will be German. The primary goal of the course is to introduce you to the area of linguistics known as syntax with particular reference to the syntactic structure of Modern Standard German. In the process, you should gain a sense of what it is like to develop a formal model of (a significant fragment of) the knowledge that is represented in the brains/minds of native speakers of a given natural language (in our case, Modern Standard German) through formulating, testing, and revising explicit hypotheses about this mentally represented grammatical knowledge. You should also significantly extend your conscious knowledge of various aspects of German grammar. After reviewing some basics of the forms of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and articles at the very beginning of the course, we will consider the basic architecture of German clauses, with special attention to verb placement and the effects of different orders of other elements within the clause. We will then turn to similarities and differences between German and English in the realm of the realization of argument structure and to alternations within German in this realm. For example, in English you can \x93answer a person\x94 or \x93answer a question\x94, but you cannot \x93answer a person her question\x94\x97\x93answering a person\x92s question\x94 does not necessarily imply that you \x93answer the person\x94 (who could be absent when you answer her question). In German, however, we find \x93einer Person (DATIV!) antworten\x94 or \x93auf eine Frage antworten\x94. Neither \x93eine Person (AKKUSATIV) antworten\x94 nor \x93eine Frage antworten\x94 is possible, but \x93einer Person auf ihre Frage antworten\x94 is possible. Finally, it is possible to have \x93eine Frage beantworten\x94. We will seek to identity and characterize systematic differences between English and German as well as systematic alternations within German, including the active/passive alternation, the causative/accusative alternation, the dative alternation, the locative alternation, and the genitive/von alternation. It is not assumed that you are already familiar with these phenomena when you enter the course. Rather, it is expected that you will learn about them in the context of the course. No previous background in linguistics is assumed. There will be no textbook. The course is based on the \x93discovery approach.\x94 Instructor-generated handouts will supply the raw data that we will need. Regular class participation is absolutely crucial to your success and enjoyment in this course. Grades will be based on class participation (30%); 5 written assignments (50%); final exam (20%)."

Jahrhunderts; und zweitens, mit dem Einflu\xDF Wagners auf die Entwicklung der Spielfilmmusik sowohl innerhalb, als auch au\xDFerhalb Deutschland, der immer noch in den neuesten Filmen unserer Zeit zu sp\xFCren ist. Wie kam es dazu, da\xDF die Ideen eines deutschen Opernkomponisten zu den \xE4sthetischen Prinzipien des modernen Hollywood-Blockbusters beitragen konnten, und woran k\xF6nnen wir den Einflu\xDF Wagners im modernen Film erkennen? Das werden eben die zentralen Fragen des Kurses sein. Um nach Antworten zu suchen, werden wir einige theoretische Texte Wagners lesen (\x93Die Kunst und die Revolution\x94; \x93Das Judenthum in der Musik\x94; Ausz\xFCge aus \x93Das Kunstwerk der Zukunft\x94 und aus Oper und Drama) und uns mit Passagen aus einigen seiner einflu\xDFreichsten Musikdramen vertraut machen (dem Vorspiel zu Tannh\xE4user; dem Vorspiel aus Lohengrin; Das Rheingold; dem \x93Walk\xFCrenritt\x94 aus Die Walk\xFCre; \x93Siegfried\x92s Trauermarsch\x94 aus der G\xF6tterd\xE4mmerung; dem ersten Aufzug von Parsifal). Danach besch\xE4ftigen wir uns mit Ausz\xFCgen aus Texten von drei der bekanntesten Kritikern Wagners (Friedrich Nietzsche, Der Fall Wagner; Theodor W. Adorno, In Search of Wagner; Bertolt Brecht, \x93Anmerkungen zur Oper Aufstieg und Fall der Stadt Mahagonny\x94). Und dann untersuchen wir drei Aspekte des modernen Films: 1) die Verfilmung von Wagners Musikdramen (Syberberg, Parsifal); 2) die Anwendung von Wagners Musik im Soundtrack (z.B. Chaplin, The Great Dictator; Coppola, Apocalypse Now; Russell, Mahler; Wertm\xFCller, Seven Beauties; Landis, Blues Brothers; Glazer, Birth; Boorman, Excalibur); 3) die Komposition und Anwendung von Wagner-\xE4hnlicher Musik (Riefensthal, Triumph des Willens; Scott, Gladiator); 4) die Anfertigung von Filmmusik nach den \xE4sthetischen Prinzipien Wagners (vor allem dem \x93Leitmotiv\x94) (z.B. in Curtiz, Mildred Pierce; Lucas\x92s Star Wars-Filmen; und Jackson\x92s The Lord of the Rings). Es ist \xE4u\xDFerst wichtig, da\xDF alle Studenten sich an den Diskussionen teilnehmen, sonst kann der Kurs nicht erfolgreich sein. Deswegen wird die Teilnahmenote nicht nur von Ihrer Anwesenheit abh\xE4ngen, sondern von Ihrer Teilnahme. (It is extremely important that all members of the class participate in the discussions; otherwise, the course cannot be successful. For this reason, the participation grade will not be based on attendance alone, but solely on participation in the discussions.)

We will look at several approaches and methods of language teaching: from early 20th century trends to current communicative approaches, as well as a broad range of alternative methods. The course investigates ways in which different approaches and methods can be utilized in the foreign language lesson in order to afford a rich learning environment. Participants are required to give practical presentations of different teaching methods through short teaching sequences. We will also take a critical look at traditional dichotomies: explicit versus implicit language instruction, grammar versus communication, foreign language versus mother tongue. The concepts of language awareness, language learning reflection, and learner autonomy will be examined as indicators of a shift in language teaching towards learner-centered approaches.

Students should NOT expect that all of the course material will be concerned with the acquisition of German. The PRINCIPLES considered should be applicable to the acquisition of any language. This course will consider the lexicon in second language acquisition from a variety of perspectives, TENTATIVE including: \x84\xAB Acquisition: Are there observed ways in which L1 lexical acquisition fundamentally differs from L2 lexical acquisition? To what extent can the early stages of L2 acquisition be properly characterized as \xA1\xA7relabeling\xA1\xA8 the L1 lexicon with sound sequences based on perception of input (Lefebvre/Sprouse)? \x84\xAB One lexicon or two: Do L2ers begin to construct a second lexicon for their new language or does a single lexicon somehow expand to contain every more labels that are gradually differentially by the acquisition of semantic and morphosyntactic features associated with the new labels? \x84\xAB Language production: What can code switching and related phenomena show us about how bilinguals access lexical items? Does speaking one language somehow suppress access to the lexicon of the other language, under normal circumstances? Why do bilinguals do as well as they generally do at keeping the two languages separate in rapid, spontaneous speech? \x84\xAB Language processing: How do bilinguals access the lexicon in language processing? \x84\xAB Pedagogical: Are there special pedagogical techniques that can demonstrably enhance or inhibit acquisition of a target-like lexicon in adult L2 learners?

    :description: "The recent work of Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht has drawn attention to the repercussions the development of a widespread, institutionally sanctioned hermeneutic paradigm of interpretation has had on our interaction with aesthetic works, arguing that the emphasis philosophical and literary studies have placed on the decoding of a signified has led to the devaluation of the physical, sensate impressions vouchsafed by the signifier, by the \x93presence\x94 of the aesthetic minutiae of the work of art. In his plea for a recuperation of the material of the signifier, Gumbrecht has argued for an appreciation of the experience of that material not in place of, but in addition to the more traditional emphasis we have been taught to place on the act of interpretation as the exegesis of (a purportedly privileged, superior) hidden meaning. As the course is primarily intended to provide an introduction to diverse cultural, social, political, ideological, philosophical, and aesthetic phenomena from the 19th century, we will organize our objects of inquiry in a roughly chronological fashion and will engage in analyses that seek to consider both models of investigation mentioned above, and to ask ourselves to what extent the interplay or tensions between them also informe(d) interaction with extra-aesthetic phenomena as well. In our discussions we will consider the ramifications of specific genres\x97poetry, drama, music drama, essay, polemic, diverse forms of aesthetic prose, and painting--, as well as the on-going question of what constitutes \x93legitimate,\x94 i.e., \x93scholarly\x94 aesthetic interaction and the notion of \x93proof\x94 within literary and cultural studies. In lieu of a seminar paper, students will be asked to give a 20- minute lecture (= ca. 10pp. of text) and lead a 15-minute discussion in the final weeks of the semester on a topic mutually agreed upon by the student and the Instructor by the end of the 9th week, and to provide the class with a bibliography of works consulted.

    :description: "Soliloquies of Finitude: Narrations of Time, Life, and History in the Late Nineteenth Century This course examines narrations of life in major novels of the German and the European tradition from Gustave Flaubert and Adalbert Stifter to Theodor Fontane. It will explore how the novel\x97a genre that is poor in formal conventions\x97relies on temporality to give life its specific contours: narrative is meaningful to the extent that it portrays temporal experience. Its essence is the repertoire of meaning unfolding within the limits of finitude in which beings are enclosed. The nineteenth century sees the intrusion of time into history, biology, economy and psychoanalysis. Whereas traditional metaphysics situates essence outside temporality and conceives becoming as teleological, time now defines how and why the beings populating the world are what they are. Life is in essence limited and unfolds its finite resources in the dimensions of history and biology. The novel is the genre that corresponds to the modern way of being in the world and its rise to the most prominent among the modern genres may well be due to its formal indetermination. Thus the course will question the link between time, the novel as a genre, and the sciences of man. We will examine a selection of texts by Darwin, Heidegger, Nietzsche, Ricardo and Freud to trace the emergence of temporality in the positive sciences, and discuss novels such as Flaubert\x92s \xC9ducation sentimentale, Fontane\x92s Effi Briest, and Stifter\x92s Nachsommer. Excerpts from texts by Ian Watt, Paul Ricoeur, Gilian Beer and others will illuminate the poetics of the novel in our discussion.

    :description: "This seminar explores contemporary German avant-garde and avant- garde-inflected cinema, comparing works from three different contexts: 1. New (West-) German Cinema from the 1960\x92s and 1970\x92s, 2. a number of aesthetically unusual (and often also politically oppositional) films produced by the East German DEFA and, 3. the post-unification \x91New Berlin School\x92. As the title announces, the guiding idea is to look closely at the relations between poetics and politics, studying film languages in terms of the cultural critique they perform. In doing so, we will cover a lot of heterogeneous ground (marked, nonetheless, also by correspondences and overlap). For example, we will study the ways in which concepts of realism, the documentary and authenticity on the one hand, \x91theatrical\x92 stylistic excess on the other are configured in the (Marxist, feminist, queer) counter-cultures emerging from the West German student movement and the artistic production of East German directors struggling for political articulation space. Similarly, we will compare the critique of \x91classical\x92 narrative forms in films from the seventies and the recent \x91New Berlin School\x92 which has also been labelled as a \x91nouvelle vague allemande\x92. By thus connecting film productions from East, West and post- unification Germany, we will revisit notions of national cinema, while also studying the transnational flows which feed into the aesthetics of our different films. Exploring links between \x91dissent and distinction,\x92 we will discuss the ways in which \x91entertainment\x92 vs. \x91art\x92 or \x91avant-garde\x92 boundaries are employed, as well as challenged and redrawn, for example through the re-use of popular genres. Films to be discussed are not yet finalized, but might include R.W. Fassbinder, Katzelmacher or The Third Generation, Wim Wenders, Kings of the Road, Helke Sander, REDUPERS: Die allseitig reduzierte Pers\xF6nlichkeit, Ulrike Ottinger, Freak Orlando, Alexander Kluge, The Patriot, Frank Gerhard Klein, Berlin \x96 Sch\xF6nhauser Corner, Beyer, Carbid and Sorrel, Konrad Wolf, Der geteilte Himme/Divided Heaven, Evelyn Schmidt, The Bicycle, Benjamin Heisenberg, Schl\xE4fer, Thomas Arslan\x92s Kardesler/Geschwister, Christian Petzold, Wolfsburg (or whatever recent films I can get my hands on in subtitled versions by early fall). The class is offered for students in Germanic Studies, Communication and Culture and Cultural Studies. All materials will be available in English/with English subtitles. General reading assignments will be individualized to some degree to compensate for different backgrounds. Thus, students in German will be focusing on film theory and analysis while students in film will be focusing on German cultural history. Of course, individualized combinations of various items from both categories will be possible as well, depending on your needs. Together, we will read more specific texts pertaining to our individual films and their aesthetic strategies. Readings: 1. A course reader (on e-reserve). 2. Robert Stam.

    :description: "(Cross-listed with L712) In many languages regular phonological processes either overapply (take place where they are not phonologically conditioned) or underapply (fail to occur where they are phonologically conditioned) to increase the identity of morphologically related words. In traditional generative phonology such examples require the cycle, whereas surface-oriented approaches (e.g. Optimality Theory) posit output-output constraints. This seminar will examine in detail cases of over- and underapplication motivated by morphological identity (also called Paradigm Uniformity (PU) effects). The goal of the class is to investigate the various theoretical models that have been proposed to account for PU effects and to clarify some of the specific questions which have been discussed in recent (and older) works, such as: Should PU effects be captured derivationally (e.g. with the phonological cycle), or non-derivationally (e.g. with output-output constraints)? Do paradigms have a morphological base? If so, how is it defined? If there is a base, is it only relevant in derivational morphology, or is it also important in inflectional paradigms? Is it possible for low-level phonetic features to be involved in PU effects? How should the avoidance of homophony in paradigms be captured formally? Data will be primarily synchronic, although some diachronic examples will be discussed as well. Examples will be drawn from a wide variety of languages (e.g. Arabic, English, German, Hebrew, Latin, Sundanese, Yiddish). The course presupposes some background in phonological theory, including Optimality Theory. Students will be required to present various readings and to write a term paper. Course materials consist of a packet containing articles and book chapters, and instructor-generated handouts."

For those seeking to understand the Netherlands, national taboos and obsessions are a good place to start. These can best be gleaned from Dutch literature, especially when you look at two themes that have generally been dominant for the last 60 years: the relationship with the (former) East Indian colony and the Second World War. This course tries to give an idea why the war in Europe and Asia remain important in Dutch literature for that long. The main focus will be on The Netherlands, but we will look at parallels in other West European countries also. The course begins with an outline of the war, in Western Europe, more specifically in The Netherlands, and in the former Dutch East Indies. Three Dutch novels will be read and abstracts from other books. Furthermore, we will look critically at many films, the most well known war movie from The Netherlands as well as some other films, made in Europe.

Topics to be discussed include the rise and consolidation of the authoritarian regimes of Salazar (1928-1974) and Franco (1936-1975), the impact of the dictatorships on cultural production, and the emphasis on an agrarian as opposed to industrial state under the regimes. The course will draw on multiple disciplines, including political science, economics, history, journalism, cultural studies, and film, to examine the representation of the Iberian Peninsula\x92s isolation through 20th-century literary manifestations, especially poetry, the short story, and the novel.

    :description: GLLC-G321 Intelligence and National Security (3 cr.) (S&H) (TR, 2:30-3:45) This course will begin with a look at the traditional role of intelligence during wartime and peacetime in American history and focus on the occasions when intelligence played a key role in the success of U.S. foreign policy and when it failed. We will then compare that to the post September 11, 2001 world and how the U.S. Intelligence Community has had to shift its tactics and emphasis to counter non-state terrorist threats. During the Cold War, the threat of massive retaliation against a nation that attacked the United States served as a deterrent to most, but when the attacker today may be only a handful of people motivated by religious, political or even ecological reasons and willing to be suicide martyrs, this is no longer a practical strategy. The changed threat requires a greater emphasis on Human Intelligence (HUMINT) and we will examine how an American intelligence officer goes about recruiting another person to become a spy. We will also look at the civil liberty issues as the line between foreign and domestic intelligence activities has blurred in order to counter terrorist threats that have no distinction of borders.

    :number: G104 28200
    :subject: GNDR
    :credit: ""
    :description: "This course will examine how mass media contributes to the ways we each understand gender, sex, and other aspects of identity such as race, sexuality and body image. The course will start from the premise of gender as being separate from sex and as created and reinforced by society. We will then use feminist media studies as a lens for examining the role media plays not only in reinforcing \"traditional\" ideas about gender, but also the role media can (and often does) play in resisting those traditional ideas and in creating alternative images and ideas. Students will be introduced to some of the key works of feminist media analysis and will be taught the skills of how to analyze and discuss various media examples through feminist points of view. Some topics to be discussed include the media's representation of bodies\x96both male and female; the \"performance\" of masculinity and femininity; various theories of how to \"read\" women's and men's roles in media\x96 especially \"masculinized\" women and \"feminized\" men; and the role certain genres such as pornography, horror, action adventure, science fiction, \"chick flicks,\" and others play in reinforcing and/or transgressing gender norms."
  - :name: Sex, Gender & the Body
    :number: G105 17113
    :subject: GNDR
    :credit: "0"
    :description: Concepts of self are shaped and expressed through understandings of the nature of the body. Culturally speaking, bodies tend to be assigned to categories and to be ascribed certain tendencies, abilities, or deficiencies based on these understandings. These assigned categories and ascribed characteristics are often shaped by notions of sex and/or gender. This course addresses sex and gender as culturally and historically specific constructions of difference and identity, which are intertwined and inform one another. It investigates the ways that perceptions of sex and gender are realized in and through the body as actor and the body as subject of discourse. The investigation of these issues leads into the domains of cross-cultural comparison, science, health, sexuality, reproduction, and body image. This course is excellent preparation for further and upper level studies of gender, the body, sex differences, political, social, international, philosophical, anthropological, and cultural studies of men and women.

    :credit: "0"
    :description: Sex & Gender in Cross-Cultural Perspective investigates and compares different constructions of sex and gender around the world. The course asks how cross-cultural variations force us to rethink assumptions about bodies, sexuality, gendered social roles, and work and family. How do people in different cultures come to consider and express themselves as "men", "women", or something else? What are the social forces that constrain them to act and think as gendered persons? Most importantly, what are the potential consequences of not conforming to those norms? The course will also consider how global forces such as militarism and religious fundamentalism influence sex and gender formations. This course will also focus on the development of structures, meanings, and formations of sex, gender, and sexuality in different historical, national, geo-cultural, racial and class contexts. A main focus will be an assessment of debates in transnational and third world feminisms and queer diasporas concerning the oppression of women, as well as the regulation and suppression of various gender and sexual formations in different cultural sites both within Euro-America and beyond.

    :description: This course will explore the roots of feminist theory, beginning with the work of Mary Wollstonecraft and extending to feminist theory today. Course work and reading will focus on how the various "brands" of feminism evolved (for example, liberal, radical, socialist, and Marxist feminisms). In addition, we will explore those historical and environmental factors which both shaped and influenced feminist ideas over the past two centuries. The central issues and concerns of feminists from specific eras will be explored. Although the Anglo-American experience will be the focus of this course, feminist theoretical contributions on the intersection of gender, race, class and sexuality will be incorporated. This is an opportunity to explore some of the most famous (and some not so well-known) feminist theorists of the past and present, including Mary Wollstonecraft, Virginia Woolf, Simone de Beauvoir, bell hooks, Shulamith Firestone and Germaine Greer.

Who can enter it? Who determines when it is over, and on what grounds? This seminar examines the long history of American debates about these questions. We will consider the complex ways that beliefs and policies regarding marriage have affected national understandings of gender roles, of racial difference, of the meaning of citizenship, and of the function and reach of government. The chronological emphasis of the course is on the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, although we will conclude by discussing the place of history in the current controversy over gay marriage. Marriage and the American Nation is a methods course, designed to meet the History Department's J300 and the College of Arts and Sciences' intensive writing requirements. As we study the topic, we will attend closely to the ways in which historians use primary sources to construct historical arguments. The assignments will give you guided opportunities to try your hands at different forms of historical research and writing.

While the focus of the course will be to examine media examples of violent masculinity and femininity (and even to question if we can have violent femininity or if violent women become "masculinized"), an additional question for the course includes Does violent women's power in media examples help create a more powerful image for women in the real world? Have Buffy, Xena, Ripley, Sarah Connor, Sydney Bristow and other "tough girls" changed how our society views women, and maybe changed women's lives?

The moments and ways these representations come together are powerful in shaping how we come to think of who we are and what we should aspire to be. This course will teach students to critically analyze gender and sexuality as they are entwined and encoded in popular media representation. We will examine how these constructs of subjectivity interrelate to commonly held and frequently unquestioned assumptions about race, class, nationality, and ability. We will think about how our assumptions about gender and sexual norms are shaped through and in turn shape several prominent sites of popular culture: advertising, television, film, music, and \x93cyberculture.\x94 Students will learn to decode the messages and meanings in select examples from each of these sites. Students will also learn to understand how political and economic inequalities in the culture industries structure our sexual and gender choices, especially in terms of what it means to be \x93normal\x94 and/or \x93queer.\x94 \x95 Because this is a 300-level course, it will provide a focused interrogation of current scholarship in the field. \x95 Course will be a mixture of lecture, small group discussion, and film screenings; attendance will be taken daily and count towards final course evaluation. \x95 Authors studied will include Joshua Gamson, Judith Halberstam, Martin Manalanasan, Tricia Rose, and Suzanna Walters. \x95 Continues themes and ideas presented in C205: Introduction to Communication and Culture. \x95 Designed to improve students\x92 abilities to critically examine the representation of sexuality and gender in the media and its relationship to social discourses addressing these topics - particularly as they relate to the notions of \x93queerness\x94 in late modernity. \x95 Assignments will include written reading summaries, a group presentation and associated paper approximately 3-5 pages in length, and a final paper approximately 8-10 pages in length."

    :description: "Cultural value systems in every society rely on sets of mutually defining terms -- for example, normal/abnormal, able- bodied/disabled, heterosexual/homosexual, white/non-white -- that largely determine local attitudes of acceptance or ostracism regarding particular categories of persons. Focusing on social stigma allows us to understand how specific cultural value systems affect our most intimate senses of self, and indeed contribute to our very notions of personhood. Stigma theory speaks broadly to the nature of the social relationships that create marked categories of persons, regardless of the particular attributes devalued. In this class we look both at theory and at particular cases of devaluation, since attention to the particularities of a given stigma keys us in to the complex of cultural values that create it. The theoretical centerpiece of this course is Erving Goffman\x92s 1963 study Stigma: Notes on the Management of Spoiled Identity. We will read this text closely to appreciate Goffman\x92s insights, and attempt throughout the semester to update the language he uses to convey his points by applying his model to more recent historical and ethnographic case studies of stigmatized persons and groups. Our primary focus will be on the range and efficacy of the various strategies available for managing and/or deflating stigma. We will consider the work of artists and activists that addresses contemporary cases of stigma involving class, race, disability, gender and sexuality. We will view related film clips in class, and full length films at bi-weekly evening screenings. Online postings on a class discussion site helps students participate fully and regularly in class discussions."

    :description: African women carry heavy, growing responsibilities within their communities that bring them respect but rarely the resources they need. Following themes of autonomy and control of social, cultural and economic resources, we discuss alternatives and radical changes from pre-colonial to contemporary times and consider their relevance to African and US development policy, to African feminist concerns and to our own options. We will talk about how African women fit into important public discussions in Africa on economic development, urbanization, family breakdown, nationalism and religion. Some issues familiar in Western media, including famines, refugees, civil wars, Islamic and Christian fundamentalism, polygyny and AIDS, have special relevance for African women. They also can contribute distinctive experiences and ideas to our discussions of some problems Americans now feel sharply, such as preserving family and religious values, building mutual respect between men and women and between ethnic groups, teen or unwed mothers, budget cuts, unemployment and global economic competition. Basic concepts and analytic skills from this course will help you join in these debates effectively and learn critically from public media such as television and newspapers. By the end of the semester, you will know what major issues African women consider important to their lives, especially family and economic issues. You should be well aware of the broad range of diversity of viewpoints on these issues and familiar with some of the most common perspectives. You will also see the range of diversity in the situations of specific groups of African women, and be able to identify the most important local and international conditions that affect their position. We will concentrate on the factors that give women more or less access to key resources they need to provide security for themselves and their families. We will also consider how our actions and US government policies contribute to these influential factors.

Through its performance and its ability to elicit a kinesthetic response in performer and viewer alike, dance becomes elemental and gendered. Classical performance traditions, popular forms, and communally-embedded dance all address gender and the potential for embodied meanings. Embodied forms of discourse speak through a variety of voices and channels creating meanings that may be ambiguous and contradictory. We will examine form and meaning as we explore the danced body and its dialogic potential across Eastern and Western traditions both classical and popular.

By the end of the semester, you will know what major issues African women consider important to their lives, especially family and economic issues. You should be well aware of the broad range of diversity of viewpoints on these issues and familiar with some of the most common perspectives. You will also see the range of diversity in the situations of specific groups of African women, and be able to identify the most important local and international conditions that affect their position. We will concentrate on the factors that give women more or less access to key resources they need to provide security for themselves and their families. We will also consider how our actions and US government policies contribute to these influential factors.

    :number: G701 26746
    :subject: GNDR
    :credit: "0"
    :description: This class explores a variety of feminist approaches to law. We will begin with a review of the development of several schools of feminist legal theory, including liberal feminism, cultural or relational feminism, dominance feminism, and postmodernist feminism. We will examine the perspective offered by these approaches on central issues in the philosophy of law, including the meaning of equality, the possibility of objectivity or neutrality, and the role of power. We will then apply these feminist theories to a range of legal issues, such as rape, sexual harassment and other employment discrimination, child custody, spousal abuse, the regulation of reproduction, and work/family conflict.

    :number: G701 28199
    :subject: GNDR
    :credit: "0"
    :description: Dance does not exist except as it is realized in the human body. Through its performance and its ability to elicit a kinesthetic response in performer and viewer alike, dance becomes elemental and gendered. Classical performance traditions, popular forms, and communally-embedded dance all address gender and the potential for embodied meanings. Embodied forms of discourse speak through a variety of voices and channels creating meanings that may be ambiguous and contradictory. We will examine form and meaning as we explore the danced body and its dialogic potential across Eastern and Western traditions both classical and popular. Seminar participants may choose any genre or tradition of dance or dance- theatre for their research.

Topics to be discussed include the rise and consolidation of the authoritarian regimes of Salazar (1928-1974) and Franco (1936- 1975), the impact of the dictatorships on cultural production, and the emphasis on an agrarian as opposed to industrial state under the regimes. The course will draw on multiple disciplines, including political science, economics, history, journalism, cultural studies, and film, to examine the representation of the Iberian Peninsula\x92s isolation through 20th-century literary manifestations, especially poetry, the short story, and the novel. Special emphasis will be given to the Spanish and Portuguese dictatorial regimes confronting the spread of post-war democracy, opposition and democratization of the 1970s, as well as formal European integration in the mid-1980s.

Topics to be discussed include the rise and consolidation of the authoritarian regimes of Salazar (1928-1974) and Franco (1936- 1975), the impact of the dictatorships on cultural production, and the emphasis on an agrarian as opposed to industrial state under the regimes. The course will draw on multiple disciplines, including political science, economics, history, journalism, cultural studies, and film, to examine the representation of the Iberian Peninsula\x92s isolation through 20th-century literary manifestations, especially poetry, the short story, and the novel. Special emphasis will be given to the Spanish and Portuguese dictatorial regimes confronting the spread of post-war democracy, opposition and democratization of the 1970s, as well as formal European integration in the mid-1980s. NOTES: 1) This course is offered jointly with GLLC-G210 #27425 and HISP-P 290, #28041. 2) This course does not count toward the Spanish minor or major since it is taught in English. 3) The course does count for Culture Studies and the Arts and Humanities requirement.

Credit given for only two of the following: S331, S332, S333 SUBTITLE: \x93What\x92s love got to do with it?\x94: Eros in Spanish Literature and Film. Building on the knowledge already acquired in S331, this course will further explore the creative mechanics of different types of literary texts (fiction, poetry, theater) and film in Spanish. The object of the course is to provide you with the necessary tools and vocabulary for textual analysis, foster critical thinking and creative engagement with texts, and help you improve your analytical and argumentative writing skills in Spanish. The ultimate goal is to help you become a better, more active, and more sophisticated reader while enhancing your enjoyment of literature and film. Love (in its widest sense: friendship, affection, fondness, passion, desire, sex, etc.) is arguably the most recurring literary topic of all times and we will use it as a general thematic framework for the course. Although usually presented as a universal emotion, love, like literature and film, is also conditioned by cultural, social, and historical factors. As we do our readings, we will pay attention to the cultural construction of eroticism in Spanish literature and film: from an individual emotion to a feeling of solidarity with humankind and a tool for change. As we study a variety of texts, we may reflect upon them as vehicles for expression and representation of love (does writing about love affect the form of what we write? is poetry better suited for love than theater? how is love represented in such different mediums as poetry and film?), and as sites for both contesting and reproducing dominant ideas on nation, religion, race, gender, sexuality, etc. (what role does literature have in perpetuating the image of woman as sexual/love object? is it possible to write about love outside the male and/or heterosexual literary tradition?). Although the topic of love will be a common thread and organizing principle of the materials, it should not be understood as a limit to our interpretations and discussions in class. Class attendance and participation are essential to the success of the course. Assignments may include one in-class presentation, short papers, a midterm and a final exam.

The objective of this course is to provide the student with a general overview of the field of Applied Linguistics and its application to Spanish.

In addition, we will consider the practical application of this knowledge to second language acquisition from the learner\x92s perspective, specifically in relation to the acquisition of Spanish by native speakers of English. The course will focus on allowing students to developing a more thorough understanding of the structure of Spanish in order to enhance their pedagogical effectiveness in the second language classroom. In order to achieve this objective, we will review various aspects of the grammar with specific attention to the acquisition of grammatical points that are traditionally problematic for students of Spanish, including: object pronouns, the aspectual distinction (perfect vs. imperfect), the mood distinction (subjunctive vs. indicative), and SER vs. ESTAR, among other topics. In the final component of the course, pragmatics, issues related to focus on form and focus on function will be presented.

Our investigation will center on novels and short stories from Puerto Rico, Cuba and the Dominican Republic, but we will also watch several films, both narrative and documentary. We will begin our reading at the fin de si\xE8cle, a period of crisis and change in which emerging new formations of gender and sexual identity come into conflict with more traditional models. Proceeding in a more or less chronological fashion, we will interrogate discourses (both national and scientific) that attempt to classify, normalize, and legislate gender and sexuality, as well as the representation of discourses and practices that contest these normalizing impulses. We will look at the treatment of homosexuality in these narratives, as well as at the ways in which issues of gender and sexuality intersect with race and class in these particular national contexts. We will end by exploring how diaspora and globalization have affected constructions of gender and sexuality in the Caribbean context. Primary texts will include: Alejandro Tapia y Rivero, \"P\xF3stumo el transmigrado\" Miguel de Carri\xF3n, \"Las impuras\" Ofelia Rodr\xEDguez Acosta, \"La vida manda\" Carlos Montenegro, \"Hombres sin mujer\" Aida Cartagena Portalat\xEDn, \"Escalera para Electra\" Virigilio Pi\xF1era, \"La carne de Ren\xE9\" Reinaldo Arenas, A\"ntes que anochezca\" Luis Rafael S\xE1nchez, \"La importancia de llamarse Daniel Santos\" Manuel Ramos Otero, \"P\xE1gina en blanco y staccato\", \"Cuentos de buena tinta\" (selections) Mayra Santos Febr\xE9s, \"Sirena Selena vestida de Pena\" Pedro Juan Guti\xE9rrez, \"El Rey de La Habana\" \xC1ngel Lozada, \"No quiero quedarme sola y vac\xEDa\" Rita Indiana Hern\xE1ndez, \"La estrategia de Chochueca\" \x93Fresa y chocolate\x94 (Tom\xE1s Guti\xE9rrez Alea, dir.) \x93Brincando el charco\x94 (Frances Negr\xF3n Montaner, dir.) \x93Seres extravagantes\x94 (Manuel Zayas, dir.)

But all was not rosy for everyone who helped to build and shape these modern meccas of opportunity and oppression. Indeed, for its life-long residents and newcomers \x96 from the 1860s to the present \x96 the American metropolis has often fallen far short of its idealized image.

As women, men, and children, as individuals and as members of organizations, as workers and as consumers, as patriots and dissidents, African Americans have strived to achieve the promises of American freedom since the 1860s. But freedom was not easily obtained nor freely given, and quite often was forcefully denied. This course traces the history of several black freedom movements, both individual and collective, over the past one hundred fifty years, and looks particularly at the role of race, race-relations, racism, and African Americans in particular in helping to shape nearly every aspect of modern American society.

The course begins with the confident liberalism that believed the nation could \x93pay any price\x94 and \x93bear any burden\x94 in order to stop communism abroad and to promote reform at home. We then focus on the challenges that destroyed this liberal agenda: civil rights and black power, the New Left, the counter culture, second-wave feminism, the sexual revolution, the Vietnam War, de-industrialization, and the globalization of the economy. The course finishes with the examination of the more conservative order that emerged in the early 1970s to deal with the conflicting realities of limited national power and wealth, on the one hand, and rising demands for rights and opportunity, on the other. In exploring this tumultuous period of American history, students will develop their critical analytical skills by closely examining different kinds of historical evidence and their expression of ideas by writing short papers, quizzes, and exams. Assignments, which average 65 pages a week, include a variety of on-line primary sources, a textbook (Maurice Isserman and Michael Kazin, \"America Divided: The Civil War of the 1960s\"), and two films (\"The Graduate\" and \"Dirty Harry\").

This course examines the history of women\x92s movements and feminism in Europe from the late eighteenth century to the 1970s. We will take a close look at the social, economic, political, and cultural changes that accompanied the emergence of Europe\x92s first movements for the betterment of woman\x92s status in society, and we will investigate how feminist ideas and goals evolved in the course of two hundred years. During the 1700s, female and male individuals demanding improvements in women\x92s rights remained largely isolated politically; women\x92s clubs founded during the French Revolution were soon shut down. Not until the mid-nineteenth century did larger organized women\x92s movements reappear on the European political stage. How can we explain this timing? What was modern feminism\x92s relationship to the intellectual movement of the Enlightenment and to the European revolutions of 1789 and 1848? How was feminism affected by other social movements such as socialism, nationalism, and imperialism? How can we explain that matters of sexuality and reproductive rights gained increasing importance for feminists as we move into the twentieth century? How did the experience of two world wars and the rise of fascist dictatorships in interwar Europe affect the status of women and the prospects of feminism? What was woman\x92s role under state socialism in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe? These are some of the questions we will address. A key goal is to gain a better sense of the complexities, contradictions, and changing nature of European feminisms. There will be 70-90 pages of reading per week; among the books we will read are: Karen Offen, \"European Feminisms, 1700-1950: A Political History\" (a textbook); Alice S. Rossi, \"The Feminist Papers: From Adams to de Beauvoir\" (a collection of primary historical sources); and Lucy Bland, \"Banishing the Beast: English Feminism and Sexual Morality, 1885-1914\" (a scholarly monograph).

By concentrating on a fairly brief timespan (approx. 1750-1815), this course allows students to gain an in-depth knowledge of these two crucial episodes and the many different vantage points from which they have been studied. The focus for some lectures and readings will be on France, but others will stress the Revolution\x92s international significance and Napoleon\x92s Europe-wide empire. Cultural and intellectual forms of explanation will be combined with social analysis and attention to the physical world. We now think of the French Revolution having \x93begun\x94 in July 1789, but nobody at the time intended to start a \x93revolution\x94 and no one had any idea what would happen next. In the quarter century that followed, nearly every institution and tradition\x97from the Church and divine-right monarchy to marriage and the organization of work\x97was challenged and re-shaped. Fundamental features of our own political life\x97the belief in \x93human rights,\x94 the idea of the nation-state, the division of political \x93Right\x94 from \x93Left\x94\x97all stem from the revolutionary 1790s. Yet, by 1815, France again had a King, slavery had been re-imposed, and women may have had fewer civil or political rights than they did before the Revolution started. The study of the French Revolution is hence central to any consideration of social or political change. This course requires no previous study of European history or French language, but students should be prepared to work hard and think creatively. Readings for discussion include \x93philosophical\x94 texts from the time (such as Montesquieu\x92s \"Spirit of the Laws\" and Kant\x92s \x93What is Enlightenment?\x94), public speeches, police reports, memoirs, and newspaper articles. In addition, students are encouraged to analyze works of visual art (from neo-classical paintings to caricature and architecture) and to engage with the work of nineteenth- and twentieth-century historians. Lecture attendance is mandatory and grading will take class participation into consideration. Monday and Wednesday sessions will be structured by informal lectures, while Friday classes will be organized for discussion. Requirements: two short (6-7 pp.) papers; lecture attendance and well-informed participation in discussion; midterm and final exams."

Using in-class films and images extensively augmented by original sources on the internet, we will explore this era, focusing on the artists and intellectuals who produced this rich cultural heritage. In the first part of the course we will consider the pre-1914 experiments of French artists such as Henri Rousseau and Eric Satie, the assault of Dadaist and Surrealists on Western concepts of reality, and the theater of Antonin Artaud. Next we will move to Berlin to study the impact of the First World War on German culture, the development of Expressionism in painting and film, the new architecture of the Bauhaus, the radical politicization of German culture, and the final victory of Nazi art. In the third section of the course we return to Paris to see the role that the American expatriates of the 1920s played in all of this creativity, focusing on John Dos Passos, Gertrude Stein, Ernest Hemingway, and Henry Miller. At the end of each section of the course there will be a take-home exam, as well as several smaller assignments. In addition to their individual work, students will work in teams to explore images and texts from the period. Students without a strong grounding in modern culture are encouraged to take the twentieth century culture. Those who already have some knowledge of the topic should be able to expand and deepen their grasp of the period, and all students will have been able to experience at first hand the vibrant writing, films, and images of the period.

The famous example of Athens attracts much of our attention, but we will also consider the democratic experiences of other Greek city-states. The first half of the course looks at the development of democracy chronologically, beginning with the earliest signs of Greek egalitarianism and ending with the appearance of fully democratic governments in Athens and elsewhere. The second main part of the course studies the ideals and institutions of ancient democracy in the context of Greek society as a whole. The final week or so of the course touches on points of contact between the ancient and modern democratic experience. Students will complete readings from ancient authors in translation paired with works from modern scholars, and discuss these readings in weekly section meetings.

Beginning with the Minoans of Crete and the Mycenaeans on the Greek mainland, we will trace the rise and fall of these Bronze Age civilizations (including the legendary Trojan War) before moving on to the rebirth of Greek culture in the following centuries and its dramatic impact across the Mediterranean world. Topics will include colonization, the rise of the city-states, artistic and architectural advances, tyranny, the development of the Spartan state, early Athenian reformers, the first philosophers, and the invention of democracy. The course concludes with the Greeks' desperate struggle for independence - and stunning success - against the might of the Persian Empire. Students will become acquainted with the literature of the Archaic and early Classical period by reading (in translation) the works of several ancient authors in part or in whole (including Herodotus\x92 \"Histories\"), and learn about the varieties of evidence that historians use to recover the history of Greece. There will be two short paper assignments and two exams (midterm and final)."

By reading histories of music, food, cinema, dance, festivals and other cultural productions, the course will evaluate how particular activities and values shaped everyday experience and local life ways. At the same time, we will interrogate how elite and popular practices constructed new ideas of national identity and of \x93the people.\x94 Far from being an unchanging facet of daily life, we will also consider popular culture as a contested process for the enactment of gender, racial, class, and cultural differences. For this reason, politics has never been far removed from popular cultural. During the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, state policies shifted dramatically from trying to stamp out undesirable cultural practices toward reshaping them for political purposes. Thus, events such as public festivities became tied to official interventions. At the same time, we will analyze how popular cultural expressions of discontent could serve as moments of resistance to state projects of cultural domination. As we move closer to the present, we will investigate how mass media have made popular culture more difficult to control by both the state and its practitioners. Finally, throughout the course wwe will examine the dynamic of borrowing and mixing cultural forms, no less true in the colonial era than in today\x92s globalized world.

What was life like for Muslims in India during the medieval period? What were their religious and cultural practices? How did Muslims relate to the Hindu majority of the subcontinent, over which they held political supremacy? What is the position of Muslims now in the subcontinent, in the post-9/11 context? To begin to answer these questions, we will spend a large portion of lectures examining the architecture and built environment of Islam in India, as well as a wide range of the art and literature produced by South Asian Muslims.

What historical factors account for those bursts of energy, and how did Chinese civilization (unlike the Greco-Roman) manage to restore itself on traditional groundwork after hundreds of years of political fragmentation and cultural change? How did the different values of Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism achieve workable coexistence, and how did Han-Chinese society interact with non-Han peoples from the steppe region who often outstripped them militarily? What accounts for developments in the literary and visual arts which defined the great Chinese traditions in those fields of creativity? And how did the Chinese themselves write and interpret their own history throughout this era of both exciting and devastating change? These are some of the questions we will address during the semester. We will proceed in a lecture-discussion mode.

The goal is to extend your mental map of the country across time, as well as space. To this end, we will alternate between a birds-eye view of important events and trends, and reconstructing what the early American scene looked like through the eyes of people on the ground. You will meet, among others, the Powhatan Indian Pocahontas and the explorer John Smith, President George Washington and his runaway slave Ona Judge, and the nineteenth-century travelers Harriet Martineau and Alexis de Tocqueville. The course will not only expand your knowledge of the American past, but also help you develop the analytical skills that make the study of history a useful path into a range of professions. Readings emphasize primary sources such as maps, travel journals, letters, and legal documents. There will be short weekly exercises designed to help you analyze and argue from these materials, and to foster class discussion. There will also be a mid-term and a final.

This course is part one of a two-course sequence on the history of Latin America from pre-conquest times to the present. It will survey the history of Latin America from its first inhabitation to the independence period in the nineteenth century. Six major themes will be addressed: the development of the great Amerindian civilizations, the encounter between Europeans and Amerindians, the making of a colonial society in Spanish America and Brazil, the struggles leading to the collapse of colonial rule, and the civil wars of independence. The overriding concern of this survey is to provide an understanding of how the complex interaction between the different cultures that met in the Americas shaped these colonial societies, and how some elements of this legacy persisted and/or were transformed by different social groups before and after independence. This knowledge of colonial Latin America will help us interpret and understand first-hand accounts of this period, pivotal skills that we should cultivate in order to critically analyze any current event in Latin America, the United States or the rest of the world. Readings include a textbook by Jonathan C. Brown, \"Latin America: A Social History of the Colonial Period,\" an Aztec account of the conquest (\"The Broken Spears\"), a collection of documents (Kenneth Mills and William B. Taylor, \"Colonial Spanish America: A Documentary History\") and a course packet. Documentaries and films are also part of the course materials.

    :description: "A portion of the above class reserved for majors Above class open to graduates only Maybe more so than anywhere else, the twentieth century was a time of extreme contrasts for European civilization. Two world wars, the rise of fascism and Stalinism, and large-scale genocide mark the dark sides of Europe\x92s twentieth century. Yet, the twentieth century also witnessed major advancements in European democracy. It brought the downfall of property and gender-based suffrage restrictions and the emergence of welfare states aimed at alleviating the social inequalities and hardships of the capitalist market. In the decades after 1945, stable parliamentary governments increasingly prevailed in Western Europe, and by the end of the 1980s, largely peaceful revolutions had swept away Eastern Europe\x92s repressive state- socialist regimes. This class will focus on the complexities and contradictions of European history between 1900 and 2000; we will also ask to what extent the weaknesses of European democracy have been overcome successfully in recent decades. What have Europeans learned from the disasters of the twentieth century, and what are the prospects for a transnational European identity? The readings draw on a broad range of analytical approaches and include national case studies as well as comparative works. Some of the books we will read include Mark Mazower, \"Dark Continent:Europe\x92s Twentieth Century\"; Modris Eksteins, \"Rites of Spring: The Great War and the Birth of the Modern Age\"; Michael Mann, \"Fascists\"; Detlev J.

The semester\x92s class meetings are broken into two sections. For the first half of the semester we will read and discuss some of the foundational texts and moments in the development of postcolonial theory. We will begin with a discussion of Edward Said\x92s 1978 text, \"Orientalism,\" together with some critiques and more recent re- evaluations of Said\x92s importance. The principal issues which Said raises, including the nature of representation, power relations between groups, and possibilities for resistance to the dominant, will then be discussed by reference to some of Said\x92s own pre- cursors, including Michel Foucault, Antonio Gramsci, and Franz Fanon. More recent postcolonial scholarship will then be considered, including the \x93linguistic turn\x94 of Homi Bhabha, and the Marxist-inspired Subaltern Studies Collective. The readings during the second half of the class will be driven by the interests of graduate students themselves. For example, we may wish to spend this time discussing issues as diverse as the influence of anthropological theory upon history writing; theorising the use of visual media in critical theory; issues of gender and sexuality; negotiating travel writing as a historical source; the idea of globalization and its relationship to imperialism; and so forth.

This great debate about the role of conflict in human life remains at the core of many of the most important issues facing us today. Therefore, in this seminar we will explore notions of conflict produced by a diverse group of writers, including Thomas Hobbes, Adam Smith, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Adolf Hitler, and E.F.

This most obsessively beloved and fascinating work of Chinese literature can be read not only as a masterpiece of semi-vernacular prose but also as a window on the complex social and psychological relations within a large, wealthy family as its good fortune peaks and declines. On one level, it tells the story of an unusual boy, born into this family with a magic jade in his mouth\x97of his idyllic childhood growing up in the company of his female cousins, doted on by his grandmother and other senior women but averse to joining the male world represented by his overly severe father. On another level, it plays out a cosmic allegory of interpenetration between the \x93real\x94 and the \x93unreal,\x94 between \x93waking\x94 and \x93dreaming\x94 in human consciousness. Besides writing short, collaborative responses to discussion questions in class, each student will produce, during the semester, a total of about 30 pages of research prose on topics that he or she finds particularly engaging in the novel. This may be done in three 10-page papers on different topics, or in the three-stage development of a 30-page paper on a single, broader topic. (Preliminary bibliographical help is provided by the professor on most subjects that attract student interest in \"The Dream.\") Class discussions will frequently be supplemented with clips from popular Chinese television enactments of scenes from the novel. The best English translation of the novel is that by David Hawkes and John Minford, \"The Story of the Stone,\" published in 5 volumes by Penguin Classics. In our class, we will collectively read only vols. 1, 3, and 5 of this edition (summaries will be provided of major events in vols. 2 and 4). For background knowledge on the period during which this novel was written, we will also read from Naquin and Rawski, \"Chinese Society in the Eighteenth Century.\" Students who may be studying advanced Chinese and who wish to read passages from the original text for one extra credit may sign up for that, with the approval of Prof. Lin Zou of EALC, under the course number E495.

And yet, as important in world history as Hiroshima as cataclysmic event was, Hiroshima as a place, as a city, lives on even today, rebuilt, bustling, a thoroughly contemporary, global city. Hiroshima, moreover, had a long history prior to its war-time bombing, a history that stretched far back into centuries when samurai represented the ruling class of Japan and the shogun reigned, back to a time when the clash of modern empires that eventually resulted in Hiroshima\x92s obliteration could not possibly have been imagined. This class will explore the history of modern experience through the lens of one city. We will attempt to trace the warlord roots of the city of Hiroshima in the sixteenth century, follow rapid changes on the urban terrain of Japan during the modern period, and discover the links between the venerable city and modern imperialism.

We will look at the impact of European migration in early modern period (~1500-1800), including the forced migration of, in particular, Africans as perpetrated by Europeans. We will then turn to European migration history over the past two centuries. In particular we will focus on the massive migrations of the mid- nineteenth to early twentieth century and so the creation of the so- called neo-Europes (European origin populations in N and S America, Oceania, South Africa). Time allowing we will look at the post- colonial migration of \x93extra-Europeans\x94 into Europe (since about 1950). There will be no assumption that students can do research in European languages, and research papers on European migration to the US using US sources will be an option."

Beginning with the religious foundation of marriage in the Catholic and Protestant traditions and ending with the future of marriage in contemporary American society, the class will investigate how major historical events have shaped people\x92s matrimonial expectations. As two major themes in our study, love and sex play important roles when we look at the meaning of marriage across time. Aside from becoming experts on the topic, students will learn how to think and write like historians and how to analyze historical and academic texts. Class assignments may include a genealogical assignment, short papers or in-class writing assignments and exams. This course has no prerequisites.

We will focus on life on the home front, on social and cultural issues, as much or more than on military or diplomatic issues. We will certainly study the American people, but this is a world history course, so we will also pay large attention to the Japanese, Russian, German, French, British and other peoples whose lives were so drastically affected by the largest and most brutal war in human history. We hope in the end to have an understanding of how America\x92s war- time experiences compared with those of other peoples and of the many ways in which World War II changed ordinary people, nations, and the world, even down to our own time. Assignments will require students to read a general introduction to the war and specialized readings, study web sites, and view films. There will be in-class and out-of-class writing.

We will examine the speeches of politicians, party propaganda, slogans, and other discourse types aimed at influencing the political process. Also examined is the language used in communicative events like congressional or parliamentary sessions, cabinet meetings, state of the union address, and so forth. The political actors whose language will be examined include presidents and vice-presidents, members of Congress, parliamentarians, senators, governors, and action group members. Because the course involves investigating how language and politics influence each other, the course will cross disciplines like political science, journalism, and communication. To help broaden students' perspectives on language and politics the course will not focus exclusively on language and politics in the United States. To this end, the course will occasionally cross cultural/national boundaries by observing data from the United Kingdom and non-Western cultures, especially Africa (Ghana).

    :description: "TuTh 7:15-8:30pm Ludwig van Beethoven still stands for many as the symbol of the defiant genius who changed the notion of the artist in society. The Romantics hailed him as the composer whose greatness of heart overcame his deafness. For the Modernists he was the first avant- garde artist, a composer who introduced radically disturbing new music to suspicious audiences. Recent criticism has shown him to be a clever self-promoter of his own myth. Which was the real Beethoven? Beethoven\x92s life (1770-1827) spans the great democratic revolutions, the Napoleonic wars and the reinstitution of conservative cultural forces in Europe. This course offers a reconsideration of Beethoven\x92s life and work, with study of both little-known works and famous masterpieces. Study of the opera Fidelio, the chamber music, his song repertoire, and the piano sonatas. Survey of pertinent cultural artifacts in poetry, painting, philosophy and more. Among the figures to be explored in the context of Beethoven\x92s work are Goethe, Schoepenhauer, Friedrich and Napoleon. Recent scholarly treatments and traditional views will be compared and contrasted.

    :credit: "9"
    :description: "TuTh 9:30-10:45am This course, team-taught by professors, physicians, patients, health- care professionals, and clergy--will explore the profound and even mystical relationships between literature and medicine. The course will survey different ways people, both experienced and first time writers, have chosen to reconstruct their experiences in narrative and cinematic form with chronic life-threatening illnesses. Beginning with literary notions of mimesis and the reconstruction of the self (or the illusion of the self), the course will examine selected prose narratives. For the most part, we will read traditional texts, but we will also sample some unconventional unruly texts, such as electronic illness narratives, which invite the reader to participate in the creation of the online text. These, together with films in which the hero/patient/narrator has been afflicted with a catastrophic illness--an experience which he then tries to reconstruct for the reader--provide a broad view of this newly emerging genre. Through critical reading and viewing, class discussion, and guided research, I hope that students will gain both an appreciation of the experience of chronic illness and of the literary and cinematic variation of the strategies used to reconstruct these experiences in what has been called America\xB9s new adventure story, \xB3the pathography,\xB2 as well as in film, music, and dance. Along the way, we will want to ask the questions: To what extent is the image of the sufferer limited by the boundaries of the art form itself? Are some genres and narrative points of view better at reconstructing the illness experience than others? Why? And there are several additional questions we want to address this semester as well: Is there perhaps both a palliative and, in some cases, a healing effect associated with this kind of writing, that is, to what extent is the writing itself a kind of therapy? Does the image of the sufferer that emerges from these accounts really amount to the image of the disease (perhaps a socially conditioned one) that is anthropomorphized? Or does such writing represent a new American ritual aimed at shaping our own ends? And if so, is this really the logical result of baby boomers who, at mid-life, as Marilyn Webb has claimed in The Good Death (1997), have \xB3altered everything else they have passed through in their life cycle\x97from sex to childbirth to marriage...and who are now in the process of changing how Americans handle the experience of dying\xB2? Are then auto/pathographies merely icons of middle class social change? \xB3I would like to learn to live finally,\xB2 Jacques Derrida declares in his Apprendre \xE0 vivre enfin. \xB3No. I have never learned-to-live. But then , really not at all! To learn to live, that must mean to learn to die, to take into consideration, in order to accept, absolute mortality.\xB2 From those who have \xB3learned to live,\xB2 from those who have accepted their absolute mortality, what can they teach us about living? We might very well ask ourselves, \xB3Can this be taught?\xB2 \xB3Can it be learned?\xB2 What do those who are about to lose their lives, have to tell us about how to live ours? And then there is the problem of memory itself. What can the chronically ill or anyone really remember? Is this really a place in the brain? Most neuroscientists think that what we call memory is really a rich circuitry of pathways and connections that lead to certain areas of the brain. They argue that every \xB3memory\xB2 is a newly created image caused by certain connections and synapses in these areas of the brain, some of which are in what are calledbunches of spindle cells. So just what \xB3memories\xB2 can we believe in? II. The major project in the class will be to \xB3adopt\xB2 a chronic illness, research the disease, and then reconstruct the experience of the illness, usually in a fictive narrative, although students are encouraged to explore recreating the experience of illness in other art forms as well. The goal of this assignment is to learn enough about the illness experience of a particular chronic condition so that a student can fashion a persona in a narrative framework that would approximate a patient\xB9s experience writing about his illness in chapter six of an illness narrative. The most successful fictive autopathography, then, might not be the most artistic, but rather the most mimetic, or representative of how a particular patient would recreate his experience from within the context of his illness. These then will be presented to the class in an interactive \xB3performance\xB2 at the end of the semester . We will begin by creating life maps to learn about the problems inherent in writing about the self and then we will write notes toward a living will; next, we will create our own pain and suffering scales, both as practical exercises and as testaments to our \xB3pre-class\xB2 attitudes toward illness, suffering and death. Following this, we will discuss the form and current popularity of pathographies in an attempt to see this phenomenon as a response to the lack of a central cultural myth regarding death in the United States. Then we will try to get at which reconstruction of illness is the most compelling read. Next, for the mid-term, we will research a specific chronic illness and write a short paper describing the etiology, symptoms, complications and treatment of our adopted diseases. To help us with this aspect of the class, physicians and other health-care professionals, as well as patients will visit the class to help us better understand the medical and personal side of the accounts we are reading. Throughout the term, we will be analyzing narrative techniques used by pathographers to reconstruct their experiences. We will try to understand what it means to be \xB3inside the experience of chronic illness,\xB2 all the time trying to learn how these patient/writer/narrators have written about themselves as a second self that has emerged from within this indelible experience. Portions of the final fictive pathographies, which will be turned in for ungraded evaluative readings by me and about which I will hold individual conferences with each student during the later part of the semester, will be presented to the class in the MAC. On the last day of class, the completed Fictive Pathography (12-15 pages)-- together with the last critical essay (5 pages) evaluating both the literary features and quality of your account and an updated notes toward a Living Will (two pages), plus the pain and suffering scale-- will be turned in for a final grade. As noted, the fictive pathography, the last critical essay written evaluating it, and the living wills will constitute 50% of the final grade. III Required Texts: Albom, Tuesdays with Morrie Course Reader Domnick, Needles Grealy, Autobiography of a Face Hornbacher, Wasted IV Evaluation: There are no tests in this course. To measure your academic achievement of the goals set out in the Course Description (understanding the experience of chronic illness and the varieties of ways this experience may be represented in print, film, music and dance), I intend to evaluate your mastery of the class material in roughly the following proportions: Class Participation* 30% Critical Essay #1 (IW) (5 pages) 15% Mid-term Etiology Essay (3-5 pages) 5% Fictive Pathography (15 pages) 30% Critical Essay #2 (5 pages) 10% Notes toward a Living Will (3-4 pages) 5% Life Maps and Pain and Suffering Scales 5% *A Note about Class Participation This course was designed to be a seminar; that is, a small class, (twelve to fifteen honors students), who would sit around a long table to discuss the profoundly moral, social and biotechnical issues involved in the illness experience and its representation in print, film, music and dance. In spite of the current enrollments in the class, I still try to maintain this seminar-level intensity. This means I expect that everyone in the class will contribute to the class discussion on almost a daily basis. A good class is always a joint effort. Participation in the class online discussion forum is also a requirement for the class. If for some reason you are unable to attend class one day, or that you are unhappy with your performance in class any day, or that you simply wish to continue a discussion that came to an arbitrary halt at the end of class, you can post your comments on the class email forum, which will be read and available to everyone, including me, everyday. I encourage everyone to use this forum to ask each other questions, seek advice from other class members and use this forum to post your class comments, and so on. (I check this site and answer all questions posted to me seven days a week.) Or you are free to visit me any day to talk about the class or email me about some class issue.

These themes will be connected to a more general consideration of intercultural relations and cultural Otherness. Students will be encouraged to reflect upon such questions as: How does the cultural background of the traveler influence her/his perception of the new country? How does the contact with a different culture influence the traveler\x92s own identity? How can cultural exchange and contact help fighting stereotypes? What is the price of integration? Finally, in the case of the Italian migration to North America, what is the evolution of Italian American culture in the United States? The first part of the course will discuss the experience of Italian famous travelers, including Marco Polo\x92s journey to the Far East and Casanova\x92s description of his wanderings throughout Europe. The second section of the course will be devoted to discuss literary works and films on the Italian American experience. Particular attention will be given to autobiographical writings by Italian American authors and to Francis Ford Coppola\x92s film trilogy inspired by Puzo\x92s The Godfather. Students in this class will write three short essays, a final exam, and participate in an oral presentation."

We will debate the meanings of such ideas as morality, freedom, nature, rationality, faith, doubt, suffering, and beauty, and will consider in particular the arguments of those thinkers who want to place the individual at the center of such inquiries. In this light, we will have cause to ask about the practices and performances of selfhood that each thinker would have human beings enact, and about the path to wisdom that is thereby recommended. Authors will include Plato, Anselm, Spinoza, Kant, Kierkegaard, and Thoreau, as well as readings from the Jewish and Christian Bibles.

The course is, in part, an introduction to the varieties of fiction\x97epistolary, sentimental, gothic, romance, realist, naturalist\x97written between 1790 and 1900. We\x92ll give our reading a consistent focus, however, by concentrating primarily on what the texts we read have to say about gender. Writers and readers during this time began to think in new ways about how men and women should act. The texts we read indicate some of the ways writers participated in shaping new ideals of manhood and womanhood. The ideals I\x92m speaking of here are generally said to be middle-class; the ideals are, that is to say, those of the audience most likely to have read the books and stories we will ourselves read. We will be concerned with how such ideals simultaneously offer middle-class readers freedom and constraint. We will examine, too, how the limits of gender ideals are revealed in texts that focus not on middle-class heterosexual couples, but that look instead at the all male world of one of Melville\x92s many ships, or that focus on a woman slave, or on a bachelor seated by his fireside, or on women who worked in the Lowell cotton mills. Reading Kate Chopin, The Awakening Hannah Webster Foster, The Coquette Nathaniel Hawthorne, The Scarlet Letter Washington Irving, (Selections TBA) Harriet Jacobs, Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl Henry James, Daisy Miller Lowell Mill Girls, excerpts from the Voice of Industry.

We will contrast two feminist ideals: a world in which gender loses its salience, and the terms \x91masculine\x92 and \x91feminine\x92 are listed in dictionaries as obsolete, and a world in which the feminine is reconceived (and perhaps the masculine, too), and not associated with weakness, fragility, and subservience. We will explore this and related issues through an array of readings from a variety of disciplines. We\x92ll begin with Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, and then read an essay by Alice Walker, \"In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens,\" that affirms and extends some of Woolf's points but also takes issue with her. Some short essays by Adrienne Rich will, like Woolf\x92s and Walker\x92s work, suggest the second feminist ideal: one in which gender is not deemphasized, but the feminine is reconceived. Other themes and questions we will pursue in this course include gender socialization and nature/nurture issues. We\x92ll examine these via Sandra Bem\x92s The Lens of Gender (and also see in that work the first ideal indicated above), as well as John Stuart Mill\x92s The Subjection of Women. Other readings will include an essay by Susan Brison, excerpts from Plato, Aristotle, Freud, and Margaret Mead; an essay on tensions between feminism and multiculturalism by Susan Moller Okin, a short story by Thakur (Tagore), and chapters of Martha Nussbaum's Sex and Social Justice (in particular, those addressing tensions between cultural relativism and commitments to address grave injustices). (Nussbaum, incidentally, will be at IU as a Patten lecturer in February, 2008.) We will also read some of Carol Gilligan's In a Different Voice, and critical discussions of Gilligan's work by Michele Moody-Adams and Claudia Card. The authors include political scientists, psychologists, philosophers, a poet and essayist, and two outstanding writers of fiction. The readings are for the most part challenging, and are quite varied in scope, style, and disciplinary approach. Depending on the students' interests, we may read some legal literature on rape, addressing in particular the question of what counts as sexual consent, and perhaps also discuss the standard of the reasonable person in criminal law and questions of whether it can succeed in being gender-neutral. I also plan to show some films: \x93The Yellow Wallpaper\x94 (tying in with the readings by Woolf and Mill), \x93Yo, la peor de todas [I, the worst of all]\x94 which also ties in with A Room of One\x92s Own, and \x93Small Happiness,\x94 about gender issues in rural China (and about the power and function of sexist ideologies). Requirements will include two papers and a final (essay) exam, and a (low-key) interview project. This course is open to all Honors students, with no prerequisites (and no expectation that one consider oneself a feminist)."

The goal of this course will be to read, discuss, and write about a range of difference examples of this emergent literary genre to explore how\x97and why\x97our increasingly visual culture has embraced this visual narrative form. Understanding the graphic novel as a literary genre means thinking about some key questions of textual and visual representation. What does it mean to live in a visual culture, and what are the interpretive skills necessary to function within it? How do graphic novels require a certain kind of visual literacy in order to communicate their fictional and non-fictional narratives? How is representation that combines the textual and the visual different than either form of representation alone? These questions will be central to our exploration, for they are shaping our very understanding of what it means to read, to interpret, and to be literate in contemporary culture. Our texts for the semester will very likely include the following (and perhaps a few others): \x95Daniel Clowes, Ghost World \x95Joe Sacco, Safe Area Gorazde \x95J.P. Stassen, Deogratias: A Tale of Rwanda \x95Marjane Satrapi, Persepolis: The Story of a Childhood \x95Adrian Tomine, Summer Blonde \x95Chris Thompson, Blankets \x95Chris Ware, Jimmy Corrigan: The Smartest Kid on Earth Assignments will include four shorter (two-page) response papers to prompts I\x92ll provide, two longer (5-6 page) interpretive papers about our texts, a short in-class group presentation, and most likely a final exam on concepts we\x92ll be discussing that give us a more informed perspective on how visual narratives function.

In truth, for human beings, food -- the control of our food supply and its distribution - is power, and power is the essential stuff of politics. This course focuses on the politics of food in contemporary America. The course will cover four major topics: food and political identity, politics and the American food industry, the politics of hunger in the United States, and the Slow Food movement against the McDonaldization of America (and the world). I have not yet selected the books for the class, but they may include Marion Nestle, Food Politics, Peter K.

It focuses on debates during the American \x93Founding\x94\x96- roughly, from 1765 to 1830\x96- over the meaning of such terms as democracy, liberty, capitalism, Christianity, and family. These terms, and other similar keywords of public discourse at the Founding, signified values the meanings of which were then much disputed-- politically, legally, and constitutionally. Each week the course will focus on such a keyword and how it was disputed. The readings will vary as to the political and scholarly strategies of the respective authors. But in their various ways, all the authors use history to make arguments about Americanism, \x93then and now.\x94 As Bendetto Croce said, \x93All history is current history.\x94 Accordingly, the course will also include routine short reading assignments drawn from current newspapers or magazines, about disputes over our course keywords today. The course aims to offer students ways of thinking about \x93our\x94 Culture Wars, ways of thinking that advert to history for perspective and that make use of history for political, legal, and constitutional argumentation. After all, we can see our journalists, our politicians, and even our United Sates Supreme Court discussing and using history all the time-- not least, the history of the so-called \x93Founding\x94 era. (And remember: the instructor, although first and foremost an historian, is also a law professor.) The course is designed as a colloquium, to facilitate and require classroom discussion. The weekly history readings will tend to be rather short, variously demanding, and often provocative. There will be routine short writing assignments, to help structure homework, focus discussion, and improve writing skills. There will be no final exam; but there will be a special midterm writing assignment, to help everyone take stock of how her or his work in the course is going. Half of each student\x92s final course grade will be based on classroom contributions, the other half on written work."

Why is it that deep-seated hatreds and accompanying violent assaults and other degredations have come to characterize so much of humankind\x92s experience? What is there in the human condition as well as in specific social-political circumstances that may help us to thwart such hatred? To respond to these fundamental questions, our seminar shall review several classic studies of hatred that have been written over roughly the past century. We constantly dialogue with these classics as we seek to understand the recurrence of human hatred. They include Sigmund Freud, CIVILIZATION AND ITS DISCONTENTS, Hannah Arendt, EICHMANN IN JERUSALEM, Richard Wright, NATIVE SON, Erich Fromm, THE HEART OF MAN, and Debra Niehoff, THE BIOLOGY OF VIOLENCE. We shall also draw on figures like Gandhi and Martin Luher King as case studies of how hatred and violence have sometimes been averted. As we discuss a specific classic and compare it with others in terms of their strengths and weaknesses, we shall each gradually seek to build our own individual perspecitve on hatred and ways to alleviate it. While our seminar focuses on discussion of some very profound writing, each of us (including the instructor) shall gradually prepare a paper setting forth our own unique positions. This position paper takes the place of exams. It shall derive not only from our agreements and disagreements with the classics on hatred. It shall also derive from a consciousness of our own experiences, ethics, memories, and values as human beings living in a very troubling world. The paper shall be written and revised again as we take in new materials and thoughts in the course of the semester. A preliminary draft of this manuscript shall be submitted monthly for criticism, comment, and suggested revisions in a meeting with the instructor."

Sometimes we are able to weigh up the pros and cons of the various options open to us. Other times we procrastinate and dither and may even end up tossing a coin or consulting Tarot cards. In this course we look at two types of basic research on decision making. We begin with an approach developed by economists and mathematicians called Rational Choice Theory which claims to describe the procedures that people should use in making decisions. Then we study results coming from a field called Behavioral Decision Theory in which psychologists and cognitive scientists describe the guidelines and heuristics that ordinary people actually use when they make decisions.

Could this casual observation, more generally, also be the reason why we might want to study the history of how our culture evolved, that is, to understand more about ourselves? Could a study of the particular transmission of the Greco-Roman civilization into the Western world actually tell us something about ourselves in Bloomington in 2003? And what is it about these particular books specifically that seem to resonate such a rare greatness that is visionary, prophetic, and even transformative to us in the West? This class will begin with a discussion of the idea of culture and then read, discuss, and write critically about selected works in the Greco-Roman world to learn how each demonstrated something visionary and transformative about their respective cultures that we have, in turn, seen valuable enough to make a part of our own culture. Throughout the semester-- during our discussion of these works\x97I will ask students where their own sensibilities seem to fall: to the intellectual tradition of the Greeks or to the Romans. Then at the end of the semester, we will choose up sides (Greeks and Romans) and have it out in a series of practical and intellectual challenges (some what like the TV series \x93The Survivors\x94) which will takes us to different campus venues, including the Art Museum, trying to show how (in Hamlet) Horatio\x92s claim that \x93I am more an antique Roman than a Dane,\x94 might be recast as \x93I am more antique Roman (or Greek) than Greek (or Roman).

As the basis of Christian theology and the ultimate source of Jewish law, it is routinely commended even today as a moral and metaphysical guide,or as a repository of dogmatic truth. But there is a significant strain in the Bible--perhaps the predominant strain- -that is impatient with piety and suspicious of dogmatic wisdom, particularly the wisdom of those who presume on their knowledge of the uncanny central figure it calls God or Yahweh. Indeed, if one reads against the grain of tradition, the Bible is a book that revels in contradiction, invites questions but frustrates answers, views human morality, like divine \x93goodness,\x94 with skepticism, and treats its characters, legendary or historical, with irreverent license. In this course we shall be exploring this skeptical strain in biblical literature, beginning with the books of Ecclesiastes and Job, continuing with parts of the Pentateuch and the Deuteronomistic History, and concluding with the Gospel of Mark. Theoretical questions about the epistemology of reading (how we know what we know) will be a constant focus, but we shall approach them through specific readings and narrowly focused discussion. Secondary texts will include essays on general and special hermeneutics as well as selections from modern biblical scholarship. Students will be asked to write several short exercises and a final paper. Prerequisite: a good background or active interest in literature or philosophy.

Scholarship on reality TV is both rigorous and voluminous, and in this course we will read many fascinating articles that seek to situate notions of real vs. reality, the tutorials on gender offered by television, the place of surveillance and obedience, the difference between documentary and \"reality,\" the role of lifestyle programming, and the neoliberal logics behind such shows as Judge Judy and What Not to Wear. Students will be encouraged to actively participate in picking the television and scholarly texts we analyze. In addition to a presentation to the class, which will also include a short 4-5 pp paper, students will write a longer analysis of a reality TV show that demonstrates their new-found capacity to critically read the medium."

    :description: "TuTh 2:30-3:45pm REQUIRES STRONG WRITING SKILLS. Among the most compelling literatures of our day is that which records and seeks to interpret the Nazi war of genocide against the Jews. This course will introduce students to this literature and encourage them to reflect upon many of the profound questions it raises. Some of these questions will focus on literature's role in the shaping of historical memory. How the past is represented and comes to acquire a future in collective memory will be a preoccupying concern. Other questions will focus on issues of the most serious intellectual, cultural, moral, ethical, and religious kind. For instance, if it is true, as Elie Wiesel claims, that at Auschwitz not only man died but also the idea of man, how do we now conceive of the human? What does a person become when nothing is any longer forbidden him? Why did art, intellect, and religion not defend against political barbarism? Is idealism of any kind still possible after Auschwitz? Is forgiveness possible? These and related questions will preoccupy us over the course of the semester. The list of required readings for this course will include all or most of the following: Anne Frank, The Diary of a Young Girl Chaim A. Kaplan, Scroll of Agony: The Warsaw Diary of Chaim A. Kaplan Elie Wiesel, Night Primo Levi, Survival in Auschwitz Primo Levi, The Drowned and the Saved Tadeusz Borowski, This Way for the Gas, Ladies and Gentlemen Bernhard Schlink, The Reader Simon Wiesenthal, The Sunflower In addition to the above, there will be some mimeographed handouts of poetry and other material, and at least one film will be shown. Written work for the course will be discussed in class during the first week of the semester. Strong writing skills will be an asset for students in this course. Please see me in advance if you have any serious reservations about your ability to meet the challenges of writing longer papers (approximately 10-12 pages each). Given the nature of the subject matter, this will be a demanding course. Students are expected to do the assigned readings on time, attend all class meetings, and participate actively in class discussions of the literature. Repeated unexcused absences will lower your grade for the course."

We will ask what kind of \"things\" their works (respectively novels and films) try to be, what kind of/ activity/ they try to perform, in the context of the current situation in which humanity finds itself. Topics to be examined: the significance of the modern novel; the birth of the medium of film; popular culture and the question of a new, democratic, people; politics and art in modernity; the rise of melodrama. Readings and viewing include: Besides Dickens and Chaplin; Plato, Tocqueville, Heidegger, Freud, Adorno, Benjamin, Arendt, Cavell. Assignments: Three short papers.

We have three challenging aims: To tease out perspectives and connections often obscured when social science is fixated on the immediate; to provide an interdisciplinary orientation to problem solving; and to raise and attempt to understand the significance of large and contentious issues. I will give a few examples of the questions we will consider: How come peoples in the Americas, Africa and Australia developed patterns of urban \"civilized\" living more slowly and incompletely than did peoples on the Eurasian continent? How did Europe, for most of human history an unimportant appendage of the eurasian continent, emerge as the dominant world area? Looking to the future, why, if the earth has undergone continuous patterns of warming and colling, does current \"global warming\" potentially pose such hazards? Or, if our interest is more political, why don't peoples around the world seem to embrace joyously our ideas of liberty and democracy? Or, turning to civil society, how can modern societies such as the United States accommodate diversity and still remain civil? In investigating these issues, we will have the benefit of reading a variety of outstanding works including Ian Buruma, Murder in Amsterdam and jared Diamond, Guns, Germs and Steel. A major assignment will be to write a seminar paper. I would be pleased to discuss details with anyone who might be interested in taking the seminar.

Drawing upon poetry, plays and novels from different periods and different regions of the English-speaking world, we will identify the basic building blocks of literary writing and develop the tools we need to analyze them. These tools will include close reading, scansion, understanding literary devices, understanding generic conventions, situating literature in historical context, and learning from literary critics. In short, the course seeks to help students become perceptive readers equipped with the necessary vocabulary and techniques to take on complex texts. Our poetry readings will range from William Blake to David Byrne, from Gerard Manley Hopkins to Gwendolyn Brooks, and from John Milton to Sylvia Plath. We will also read plays by David Henry Hwang and J.B. Priestly; essays by Virgina Woolf and Alice Walker; and novels by Joseph Conrad and Chinua Achebe. Assignments likely will consist of four short papers, a fair amount of informal writing, quizzes, presentations, and group editorial work.

    :description: Lecture TuTh 11:15am-12:05pm, Discussion Th 1:25-2:15pm This course is an introduction to the methods and theories of archaeology. Archaeology is the study of past human societies based on material remains left behind by people. We will explore the different kinds of anthropological questions archaeologists have asked about human societies in the past, and the different ways that archaeologists formulate interpretations about social organization, subsistence, environment, architecture, trade, economic systems, and political life based on archaeological data. You will learn about goals of archaeology as a sub-discipline within anthropology and the development of archaeology as a scientific discipline. Archaeologists employ a wide range of techniques to collect and analyze material remains, including settlement survey, excavation, environmental reconstruction, laboratory analysis of artifacts, dating techniques, and micro-scale analytical methods borrowed from the physical sciences. Throughout the semester, we will draw on examples of archaeological research from across the globe and will discuss major issues and transitions in world prehistory. Examples include the peopling of the New World, the transition to sedentary lifestyles, the development of cities and monumental architecture, and interpretations of everyday social life, identity, family structure, and community membership. We will also discuss contemporary issues related to archaeology, such as museums, site preservation, looting, and the use of archaeological past in nation building and ethnic politics. Students should come away from this class with a solid background in how archaeologists do their work, what we have learned from archaeological research about ancient human societies, and how archaeology can be applied to the contemporary world. This course meets for two 50-minute lectures and one discussion section per week. Students in the Honors discussion section will participate in section exercises, discussions, and activities along with the professor. Students are asked to create classification schemes for artifacts, identify plants remains, manufacture stone tools, determine a site chronology, and other hands-on activities. Students will also consider the complex issues involved in doing archaeology in the 21st century. In the Honors section, students will debate important ethical, practical, and analytical issues involving site interpretation, the practice of archaeology, and the presentation of archaeological findings to the public.

At the same time, the class will look at the growing influence of American cultures in the fascinating countries of South Eastern Europe. Students will be challenged to think about multi- cultural United States as well as the process of globalization of local cultures. The focus of this course will be on contemporary cultures in the form of literature and film and the languages that serve to define the cultural isoglosses found in contemporary South Eastern Europe. While some attention will be paid to the history of the Balkans, the course will center on the contemporary manifestations of Balkan cultures, especially by close readings of authentic texts (literature and film) in English translation. A unifying theme in the course will be the exploration of the theme of migration and how both the United States and the Balkans have been sources and destinations of migrations. Basic academic skills (writing, research, critical thinking) will be important parts of the course. All students will be required to submit short written (2 pages) or oral (5 minutes) text reviews of assigned readings or films. Students will complete a major research paper on a topic chosen in consultation with the instructor.

Government attempts to punish or restrict certain kinds of speech all the time, and sometimes when those restrictions are challenged in court, the court approves of the restrictions. After taking this course, you\x92ll understand why this happens in a country that supposedly guarantees free speech. We\x92ll start the course by reading some of the philosophers that first spoke about the benefits of free speech, and then we\x92ll look at some of the contemporary criticisms of the concept. Next, we\x92ll study most of the exceptions to free speech in the United States, including speech that incites imminent lawless action, obscene speech, and speech that violates another person\x92s privacy. Throughout the course you\x92ll practice your analytical abilities and critical thinking skills by applying what you\x92ve learned about free speech to new situations. For example, based on what you learn about restricting speech on a radio station, how would the government react to the same speech on the internet? Class instruction includes lecture, guest speakers, pertinent videotapes, and discussion. During the class, you\x92ll write several in-class \x93pop\x94essays plus two research papers on a free-speech topic of interest to you. You\x92ll also do at least one oral exercise such as a debate or a moot court argument. The course concludes with a comprehensive final examination. The honors discussion section will feature more in-depth analysis of the issues and a closer inspection of the most important Supreme Court cases dealing with free speech issues. Honors students will not necessarily do more work that the rest of the class (although some additional reading will be required), but the level of discussion and analysis will be significantly more sophisticated. After taking this course, you\x92ll understand the boundaries of free speech in the United States. More importantly, you\x92ll be able to critically assess government attempts to restrict free speech in the future."

    :description: "MWF 10:10-11:00am Course Description: How people lived, and related to each other is an important part of archaeological inquiry. Sex, is an important part of human experience. In the present, we tend to view sex as a private and natural part of human interaction. Sex is often presented as a biological function, necessary, and enjoyable. But did/do people always see things this way? We may all recognize that people have different ideas about sex and sexuality, and that such things are often culturally motivated, but to what extent can sex and sexuality be affected by culture and tradition? What evidence is there for sexual practices and beliefs in the past? In this class we will review how we can approach such questions through material remains, as well as artwork and texts from past peoples. We will interrogate the role of sex in the societies we examine, across time and space. We will be looking at how sex was constructed to be either private or public, a matter of political or religious concern, or of little public concern at all. Was sex always about sex? When are depictions of sex actually representative of other things, such as life and death, renewal, or crop fertility? Can sex be more about community, status or politics than about individuals? The goal then, is to explore a part of being human that is often assumed to be unchanging and simply biological in nature, and investigate to what degree, culture can construct conceptions of not only sex and sexuality, but also our sense of what is natural, or simply biological. Course Structure: We will mix lectures, electronic media and discussion to explore our topic. This class will utilize research publications as primary sources of information. Core readings must be completed before each class. In order to best utilize this type of material we will form small discussion groups and work though terminology, as well as anthropological and archaeological modes of discourse and analysis for each article. A student will be assigned a role as discussion leader for each group, but all will be expected to participate in the discussions and production of an article summary for their group. By the end of the course students will be able to more comfortably engage with, and evaluate research publications. WARNING: Course materials will on occasion be of a graphic nature. Discussion will also at times require a frank appraisal of materials of a sexual nature. If discomfort with such topics or sexual images would inhibit learning or impede your ability to participate in class discussion, this may not be the class for you."

Within this framework, we will address the disparity between social reality and linguistic analysis of variation. Included in this discussion are various comparisons between social beliefs and scientific fact, that is, what language entails and what the layperson understands about language and its variation. To discuss language variation, several of topics will be introduced, focusing primarily on how social and individual factors impact how we speak and use language for communication. Variables such as gender, age, race/ethnicity, geography and socio economic status will be presented to show how individual and social characteristics are reflected in language variation. In addition, the topics of cross-cultural communication, the relationship between language and culture, and language and identity will be interspersed within this discussion. Central to this discussion will be the linguistic reality present in the United States; thus, examples of variation within American English and across language communities in this country will be used throughout class. Practical applications of the issues presented and discussed in class will be included, in particular, educational practices and assessment of language disability. Applied activities will include interviews and language sampling, analysis of movies, songs, and television programs.

    :description: "TuTh 2:30-3:45pm Although being \x93for thinking\x94 sounds like a clich\xE9 (and who would claim not to be for thinking, after all), I nevertheless feel compelled to say that I really am interested in trying to help students (and myself) to get better at thinking. This course is meant to help us to do so, in the context of learning about cancer. In particular, this course is meant to help us to get better at developing, clarifying, disentangling, and analyzing thoughts about cancer as well as to get better at finding and critically analyzing evidence concerning the validity of those thoughts. This course is also meant to help students to get better at communicating. Most of the homework assignments will include writing, and most of each class period will be devoted to small- group and whole-class discussions. I would like for us to deal with aspects of cancer that students consider to be particularly interesting and important. The starting plan, which we can modify based on students\x92 interests, is that we will deal with various of the following topics and questions: The Nature of Cancers \x95What is cancer? \x95What distinguishes one type of cancer from another, and how different are different types from one another? \x95How do cancers develop? Cancer research \x95What were major discoveries in the past, and how were they made? \x95What sorts of cancer research are going on now? \x95What are the prospects of there being significant progress in preventing, diagnosing, and treating different types of cancer? Risk Factors for Cancers \x95What environmental and inherited risk factors are there for various cancers? \x95How do I determine which possible risk factors to be most concerned about? \x95How do I decide whether I might want to get genetically tested for possible predispositions to particular types of cancer? Detections of Cancers \x95What techniques are there for detecting different types of cancer? \x95How sensitive and accurate is each of those techniques? Treatments of Cancers \x95What standard treatment options are there for various types of cancer? \x95What experimental treatments are there? \x95If I were to get some type of cancer, how would I go about deciding which treatment options might be best for me? \x95How would I find out about clinical trials for new cancer treatments, and how would I decide whether and which type of trial I might want to try to participate in? There will be no exams in this course. 70% of the course grade will be based on homework assignments (writings, usually), and 30% will be based on in-class activities (discussions, usually)."

    :description: "TuTh 2:30-3:45pm The theory of computation is one of the most important intellectual developments of the first half of the twentieth century. From very slender roots, a tree blossomed in the 1930's whose fruit is the development of computers as we know them. But the same tree contains thorns, as it were; these are the 'negative results' which talk about computer programs that we can never write, and true sentences which we can never prove. These results are often taken to imply fundamental limitations on what human beings can know. They are on a cultural par with other developments that came at roughly the same time: the uncertainty principle in physics, and even with Freud's notion of an unconscious which cannot know itself. The course will be an entry point to both the mathematical theory of computation, and also to discussions of the place that the theory occupies in broader intellectual discourse. The 'math' aspect of the course presents the theory of computation and a bit of logic related to it. Students will write programs in a new language called 1#, and learn theory by reasoning about their programs. A math or computer science background is not really needed (but of course it would help). It is more important to enjoy solving puzzles and to be willing to immerse yourself in the world of abstract thinking. For example, would you like to write a computer program to do something \"weird\", such as output itself? The course will also look critically at the uses of results and metaphors from computability theory that have found their way into cognitive science, philosophy, biology, and other areas. This will involve readings of either survey papers or popular (\"Scientific American\" style) articles. The idea would be to present debates as to whether the uses of computability theory are genuine or spurious. The class will have weekly homework on the technical material. Some of the homework will involve short writing assignments. The non- technical part of the course requires two papers."

These are the types of questions that cognitive scientists and psychologists ask about people\x92s thinking, and in this course, we will apply the ideas and methods of cognitive science to the domain of food decisions. We will look at how people learn about different foods and come to have particular preferences; how we remember what we\x92ve eaten and how that influences what we will eat in the future; how social influences affect our food choices; what factors make us eat more of less; and how we can influence our own decision making about food in healthy directions.

    :description: "X100 The Art & Science of Beer: History, Technology & Culture The following is from the Epic of Gilgamesh, a Sumerian epic thought to have its roots in oral tradition over 5000 years ago. Beer and bread are here considered the hallmarks of modern human culture, by partaking of them the wild man-beast Enkidu was transformed into a human. \"Enkidu knew nothing about eating bread for food, and of drinking beer he had not been taught...Enkidu ate the food until he was sated, he drank the beer - seven jugs! - and became expansive and sang with joy! He was elated and his face glowed. He splashed his shaggy body with water...and turned into a human.\" Beer has been an important part of human culture since the advent of agriculture. Beer has been a safe alternative to water, a source of nourishment, and for at least the last 300 years, beer has been big business with annual revenues of some modern brewers topping $15 billion. Brewing typically leads industry in technological innovation and it has played a role in major advancements in our scientific understanding of the world...and not just by providing drunken inspiration. This course will examine the cultural, scientific and technological aspects of beer and its production. We will explore the place of beer in ancient as well as modern life. We will discuss the production of beer throughout history and some of the major advancements in brewing technology. Finally, we will discuss the role beer and brewing has played in important scientific achievements in microbiology, biotechnology and physics."

    :description: X100 Science and The Occult This course is designed to provide students with a historical survey of the occult as it relates to the history of science. The course is reading-intensive, with regular assignments that balance secondary social and cultural historiography of the occult with primary text readings. We will begin with ancient Greece and Rome, and proceed chronologically through Medieval and Renaissance Europe, Early Modern Europe and America, the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution, and conclude with the 20th century American occultism. The goal of the course is to provide students with an understanding of the different intellectual frameworks and social contexts which governed scientific practice (and skepticism) of the occult during different periods in Western history. In the first week of class, students will be introduced to the philosophical problem of demarcation, the historical problem of presentism, and to practical strategies for objectivity and analysis =96 all of which should facilitate productive engagement with primary texts in the history of the occult for the rest of the semester.

    :description: "X123 Science and Christianity in Western History Often depicted as enemies armed and embattled, science and religion have related in history in powerful and fascinating ways. Historical studies of science and religion provide a unique and valuable window into questions of belief, meaning, and the cultural context of science. Personal belief, influential institutions, and the larger historical contexts shaped and were shaped by science and religion in important and lasting ways. Further, an adequate treatment of the science in many pre-modern contexts requires some knowledge of religion and theology. This course aims to address such questions as \x91What is the relationship between science and religion?\x92 \x91Have things changed significantly over time?\x92 and \x91Who cares?\x92 We will also be able to examine notions of \x91popular science\x92 and engage historical controversies, including the ongoing use and abuse of the trial of Galileo, biblical chronology and geology, the Scopes Trial, and the current debates over Intelligent Design and evolution in American education. This class will consist of a mix of notable primary texts and secondary materials to assist contextualization and interpretation. Regular homework assignments, papers, short tests, and class projects will help focus and enliven our course of study."

Although some moments occasioned conflict, most of the great intellectual debates of the last 2600 years arguably have been intra- religious, intra-scientific, or both. Over the course of the last few centuries, this has changed and now science and religion are regularly described as being at war. This class attempts both to explore those great intellectual debates in their historical contexts and to seek explanations for the emergence of the science/religion dichotomy in the modern era. Topics include: theology\x97ancient and medieval\x97as science; modern natural theology and design arguments; God\x92s relation to the natural world; the pre- adamic people controversy; nineteenth-century linguistics and race science; God as creator/Man as creator/Woman as creator; scientific attempts to understand religion."

    :description: "More than three generations have passed since Church, Turing and Post delineated the limits of computation with their famous theses and in so doing laid the foundations for the theory of computing. The physics of the 21st century, however, is stretching these boundaries. Creating new computational complexity classes, the quantum revolution has penetrated computer science, and scientific journals, as well as popular literature, are saturated with debates on \x93super-tasks\x94, \x93oracles\x94 and \x93hypercomputers\x94 \x96 machines that perform infinite computational steps in finite time. Are these all- powerful machines physically possible? What are the physical features of the world that allow such reformulation of the notion of computability and complexity? How would this reformulation affect some long-standing debates in the foundations of computer science? Join us to learn more about these questions that lie on the intersection of physics, computer science, and philosophy. We shall discuss the notion of computability and the conceptual problems that arise when analyzing it. We shall acquaint ourselves with Turing machines and the computational complexity \x93zoo\x94, and with the Church- Turing thesis and the notion of recursion, and discover some surprisingly non-recursive physical processes. We shall then delve into the fascinating domain of quantum computing, and try to understand how it may affect computer science.

    :description: "X556 History & Philosophy of Science in Antiquity: Francis Bacon and His World The world of Francis Bacon scholarship has evolved radically over the last twenty years. Bacon was once heralded primarily as the father of a systematic inductive method in the sciences, but it has come to light in recent years that he was a much more diverse figure than previously thought. On the one hand, Bacon has been shown to have developed a \x93semi-Paracelsian speculative philosophy\x94 while at the same time preaching the virtues of a natural philosophy based on empirical principles. On the other hand, it appears that Bacon may himself have been more of an actual experimenter than previously thought, and it may be that he felt his \x93speculative philosophy\x94 to have been grounded in empirically proven fact. Other areas of Baconian scholarship that are undergoing rapid change include the study of his matter theory (was he an atomist, and if so in what sense?) and his attitude towards the exploitation of the natural world (did Bacon in some sense advocate the \x93torture\x94 of nature?). Yet another issue concerns the nature of Bacon\x92s influence on seventeenth-century science. Was Bacon merely a sort of \x93cheerleader\x94 of experimental science, or did he actually influence its development in some fundamental fashion? In what sense if any, can he be said genuinely to have influenced scientific practitioners such as Boyle, Hooke, and Newton? These questions and others will form the topics of the seminar."

    :description: "Introduction to International Studies (INTL-I100) I100 provides a broad introduction to the principal issues and modes of study that characterize International Studies. At IU, the International Studies Program (INTL) emphasizes the relational and comparative study of the manner in which individuals, groups, localities, and nations have confronted global issues, past and present. The Program responds to the call for individuals--in roles as citizens and future policy makers--who are trained to meet challenges through an understanding of the world\x92s interrelationships. The course will teach different perspectives for studying and making sense of the world. We will learn how these different perspectives portray the world, interpret events, and often shape human actions. Organized around the INTL thematic concentrations, the course introduces approaches from the natural and social sciences and the arts and humanities. Case studies from different historical periods and parts of the world will be used to illustrate these approaches and key issues. Among the primary course objectives are for students to: 1) develop tools needed to analyze global questions, attending to both common processes and differences across time/space; 2) strengthen an international perspective on debates surrounding critical issues, and an understanding of the multiple viewpoints with which members of diverse social groups approach them; 3) understand the impact of individual decisions on the world and of world events on individuals; and 4) continue to refine skills in communication, research, and critical thinking."

    :description: "As an introduction to the Culture and the Arts concentration in International Studies, the course is designed to provide a framework students can use when pursuing further coursework in the major. Rather than survey the various arts as practiced throughout the world, the course will engage the issues central to the concentration, including theories of art, culture, globalization, and identity. It will introduce the theoretical concept of the arts as forms of cultural expression and of representation; and we will examine the role of the arts in the formation and transformation of identity. The class will focus on the movement of the arts and culture- -through the movement of people and forms of mass mediation--and their sites of interaction. We will explore mechanisms, sites, and institutions through which the arts and culture are disseminated globally. These concepts will be developed within particular case studies through readings as well as presentations by guest speakers. Approaches to understanding--and research methods for studying-- culture and the arts cross-culturally and internationally will be taught. A substantial portion of the course will be conducted in a seminar format that will allow ample opportunity for class discussion of the materials. Class materials will consist of textbooks, articles available through e-reserves, selected videos, and internet resources. The final grade will be based on a combination of written assignments and class preparation/participation. Assignments tentatively include: 5-6 short written assignments (including 2 descriptive-analytic papers), a midterm essay exam, and an individual research project. Written guidelines for these assignments will be discussed in class. Students with interests in particular topics will find opportunities to pursue them in the research assignments."

The core of the course is the scientific study of the relationship between social or economic change, and environmental change. We further examine the ways in which this science is or is not translated into public policy. This course will prepare students for additional coursework on environmental social science from a variety of disciplines, but also stand alone as an overview of key environmental issues and their study. The semester is divided into five sections. The first section covers the basic theories, approaches and general issues in the study of human-environment relationships. The second focuses on the science and policy of climate change, while the third focuses on the science and policy of land use and cover change (LUCC). The fourth and the fifth sections present case studies of the Brazilian Amazon and the Pearl River Delta (including parts of China, Hong Kong and Macau). The course thus moves from more abstract theories to global problems and then to concrete examples of human impacts on environment and attempts to lessen or adapt to these impacts."

    :description: "Human Rights & Social Movements (INTL-I204) This class will serve as an introduction to the issue of human rights and the social movements that affect them. Human rights are those rights to which all individuals are entitled to in order to ensure their dignity. These rights are an international phenomenon. When they take place only within a society, disputes and conflicts over basic rights are generally just discussions about civil rights. It is generally when they attract international attention or involve international action that we begin to talk of human rights. Therefore all of the issues we will deal with in this course involve action across borders and relations among countries. Our primary issue will be human rights. We will address social movements in light of that topic. Social movements play both a role in realizing human rights, for instance through the work of transnational organizations like Amnesty International, but they are also often associated with gross violations of human rights, as is the case with violent independence movements or fascism. The class will not only consider contemporary dilemmas in human rights, such as humanitarian intervention, but also historical questions such as how we can explain progress in human rights such as the end of the slave trade and the creation of laws of war. A recurrent theme will be how human rights are understood differently at different times in history and in different geopolitical contexts. Our concerns will be both empirical and normative. We want to understand how human rights have evolved over time, where they have been respected and where they have been violated and why. But we also want to grapple with ethical questions such as how much of a concern human rights should be in America\x92s foreign policy, or whether there is a universal definition of what rights to which all individuals are entitled."

This convergence is sometimes referred to as globalization. As a process that expands and intensifies interactions between disparate peoples, their commerce, and their ideas, it is not new, but the process of globalization that we are witnessing today is fundamentally different \x96 the scale and reach are greatly expanded and the speed is accelerated. The evolving role of international law from diplomatic protection to the law of treaties to humanitarian law to the International Criminal Court, among others, has had a profound impact on globalization. This course will focus on the intersection of globalization and international law and the changing nature of the nation-state system. We will examine how the principles of international law and the creation of international norms impact the international responsibility of states and the various aspects of globalization."

As a necessary background to the stories of these musics, we will briefly study the geography, history, ethnic, linguistic and religious diversity of the peoples of the Silk Road. The musical component focuses on four major areas: The Arab World (North Africa, Levant regions and Middle East); the Caucasus and Asia Minor (Azerbaijan & Turkey); Iran and Afghanistan; and Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Mongolia, and Xingjian, the Western province of China known as Uyghuristan or East Turkistan). While the course will mainly focus on the Arab, Iranian, Turkic and Central Asian cultures and their peoples, the musical cultures of smaller ethnic groups within these countries and regions such as the Christians, Jews of the Caucasus and Central Asia, gypsies, and other ethnic minorities will also be discussed. The course will cover the following genres of music: \x95 Art music (Maqam/Dastgah/ Shashmaqam/ Nuba/Mowashshahat): referred to as the classical music of the sedentary cultures of the Silk Road people. \x95 Folk music of the Central Eurasia and the Middle East. \x95 Naqqali (epic storytelling), Ashiq, aqin, and Bakhshi music (bard music of the Central Asia and Turkic world). \x95 Spiritual and religious musical repertoires: Mevlevi, Baktashi, Qaderi and Ahl-e Haqq orders\x92 spiritual music; Tazi\x92eh \x93Passion Plays\x94 observed by Shiits in Iran, Iraq and Lebanon; Qur\x92anic recitation; the Central Asian Jewish cantor recitations, and the Qawwali, Sufi music of Pakistan and India. \x95 Central Asian Jewish musical traditions and Sazandah tradition. \x95 The dances and choreographies of selected regions such as the Bukhara, Kharazem, and Farghana Valley of Central Asia, Azerbaijan, Iran and Afghanistan and Turkey will be briefly studied.

L380 does not require or assume any previous acquaintance with Hebrew or Hebrew literature. Readings (all in English) will consist primarily of representative short stories and a novel. Some selections of poetry, when assigned, will be read in class. The primary purpose of the readings will be to introduce students to the culture of the shtetl, the small east European Jewish hamlet. We will be exploring the way in which literature responds and reflects major historical events in the Jewish experience of the early 20th century. In that regard, we shall explore the many forces prompting the protagonists' rebellion against that way of life with its insular piety. Yet, having abandoned the ways and values of the shtetl, the youth of those days are depicted as being left with the burden of seeking out new roots and finding a meaning for their lives. Under the phenomenon of this large cultural transformation, as we shall see, Hebrew literature had to contend with and give expression to the most central events and themes of modern times affecting Jewish life: the loss of innocence and tradition in a modern, secular, world; nationalism; the Holocaust; the rebirth of Israel; wars, peace and the individual; and the image of the new Israeli.

    :description: "Language and Politics (Obeng) (LING) (S & H) (3 cr.) There is often talk by non-politicians about issues such as: how untruthful politicians are; how they evade questions by providing answers unrelated to questions they are asked, how they refuse to answer questions, use divisive language especially inclusive and exclusive pronouns like \"we\" and \"them\", to signal polarization of in-groups and out-groups, how they use negative advertisements to attack their political opponents, how they avoid the obvious and how they speak indirectly by using metaphors and other stylistic devices. There is also talk about how politicians systematically establish a contrast between their party's properties (usually good characteristics or actions) and the ostensibly bad actions of others, how they compare what their opponents do (usually negative actions) and what their party does (usually positive acts), as well as how hedging, ambiguity, or vagueness is employed to save and maintain a politicians face. Regarding political campaigning, in the minds of some people, politicians often mention the aggressive acts such as invasions, sexual practices, bad policies, ban on free speech, etc. of their opponents and play down the opponents positive characteristics while emphasizing their negative characteristics on sensitive issues like immigration and the death penalty. This course explores the language of politics. In particular, it examines how politicians or political actors and political commentators use language to talk about politics and how politics also influences language. The language to be studied includes that used in the domain of politics such as speeches of politicians, party propaganda, slogans, the language used in communicative events like congressional or parliamentary sessions, cabinet meetings, state of the union address, and so forth. The political actors whose language will be examined include presidents and vice-presidents, members of Congress, parliamentarians, senators, governors, and action group members. The course aims at engaging students in a critical examination of the various ways in which language and politics influence each other. We will try to understand why politicians refer to their opponents the way they do, why they answer questions the way they do, and why/how the general public speaks about political actors the way they do. This course will address these strategies by providing students with the analytical tools to critically synthesize and analyze political discourse. Important course topics include: Political Speech Making (answering questions by providing evasive answers), propaganda, slogans and truth in politics; Some Basic Speaking Strategies (imitation and influence, vagueness, pronoun usage, rhetoric, and evasion); Speaking the unspeakable (metaphor, analogy, innuendo, circumlocution/spin, and exaggeration); Symbolism in politics (posters, props, and costumes); Political campaigning (manifestoes, stroking, and name-calling); reporting election results; political correctness; censorship and free speech; the Language labeling; and the politics about languages (e.g. language policy issues)."

The topics covered therefore include the parts of language (e.g., meanings, sentences, words, and sounds), the uses of language (e.g., to facilitate conversation or to request information), and the ways in which languages are acquired by children, processed by adults (plus children), and varied or changed over time (by virtually everyone).

    :description: "(Cross-listed and meets with Ger G835) In many languages regular phonological processes either overapply (take place where they are not phonologically conditioned) or underapply (fail to occur where they are phonologically conditioned) to increase the identity of morphologically related words. In traditional generative phonology such examples require the cycle, whereas surface-oriented approaches (e.g. Optimality Theory) posit output-output constraints. This seminar will examine in detail cases of over- and underapplication motivated by morphological identity (also called Paradigm Uniformity (PU) effects). The goal of the class is to investigate the various theoretical models that have been proposed to account for PU effects and to clarify some of the specific questions which have been discussed in recent (and older) works, such as: Should PU effects be captured derivationally (e.g. with the phonological cycle), or non-derivationally (e.g. with output-output constraints)? Do paradigms have a morphological base? If so, how is it defined? If there is a base, is it only relevant in derivational morphology, or is it also important in inflectional paradigms? Is it possible for low-level phonetic features to be involved in PU effects? How should the avoidance of homophony in paradigms be captured formally? Data will be primarily synchronic, although some diachronic examples will be discussed as well. Examples will be drawn from a wide variety of languages (e.g. Arabic, English, German, Hebrew, Latin, Sundanese, Yiddish). The course presupposes some background in phonological theory, including Optimality Theory. Students will be required to present various readings and to write a term paper.

The course will examine various notions of information structure such as topic, focus and contrast, and explore the ways to incorporate them into formal syntax. Major queries include: [1] Why should we pay attention to packaging of information in addition to ordering and constituency in syntax? ? Starting from Gricean pragmatics, we will seek and examine motivations for incorporating the study of information structure into formal linguistics. Keywords: Coversational maxims, Common ground [2] Is it ever possible to come up with the definitions of information structural notions which are formal enough to be incorporated into syntax? If so, how can we achieve that? ? We will survey the heterogeneous definitions and characterizations of information structural notions in the literature and attempt to arrive at a single, understandable definition of them based upon some simple and general primitive notions. Keywords: alternative semantics, predication, categorical vs. thetic judgment [3] How exactly does information structure interact with linguistic competence (grammar) and linguistic performance (processing and production)? ? We will examine the literature which attempts to reflect information structure in phrase structure, grammatical features and grammatical processes (e.g., movement) as well as prosody and parsing.

It will survey the history of Latin America from its first inhabitation to the independence period in the nineteenth century. Six major themes will be addressed: the development of the great Amerindian civilizations, the encounter between Europeans and Amerindians, the making of a colonial society in Spanish America and Brazil, the struggles leading to the collapse of colonial rule, and the civil wars of independence. The overriding concern of this survey is to provide an understanding of how the complex interaction between the different cultures that met in the Americas shaped these colonial societies, and how some elements of this legacy persisted and/or were transformed by different social groups before and after independence. This knowledge of colonial Latin America will help us interpret and understand first-hand accounts of this period, pivotal skills that we should cultivate in order to critically analyze any current event in Latin America, the United States or the rest of the world. Readings include a textbook by Jonathan C. Brown, \"Latin America: A Social History of the Colonial Period,\" an Aztec account of the conquest (\"The Broken Spears\"), a collection of documents (Kenneth Mills and William B. Taylor, \"Colonial Spanish America: A Documentary History\") and a course packet. Documentaries and films are also part of the course materials.

    :description: "This course aims to introduce students to the role of Muslims in Western Politics. Individuals who practice the religion, or who belong to ethnic groups that are traditionally Muslim are now estimated to make up some 2% of the North American population and 4% of the European Union\x92s population, and their numbers are expected to continue to grow. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the wars that followed highlighted and amplified the role and perception of Muslim minorities in the West as political actors and electoral constituencies, subjects of cultural hostility, scapegoats for poor economic performance, suspects in the face of insecurity whose rights could be exceptionally curtailed, and agents for the projection of geopolitical power. Western states and their rapidly growing Muslim populations are adjusting to each other under the constant pressure of exogenous shock. The way they manage the process will deeply affect Western polities and their relations with the Muslim World. Substantive topics that we will explore include: How and why do different states strike a balance between security and civil rights / liberties? Is there really a trade-off between the two? How do they deal with immigration, both permitted and unregulated? What factors affect the degree of political participation by Western Muslims? Why are culture clashes more salient in some countries than in others? Why do Muslim immigrants prosper more economically in North America than in Europe? How do international conflicts affect the relationship between Western states and their Muslim citizens and the dynamics among citizens of different backgrounds? Is there a connection between Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in the West? Are we witnessing the birth of a Western Muslim macro-ethnicity or many disjointed ethnic communities? How are Muslims perceived in their Western societies and how do they perceive their fellow citizens? What will the future hold?"

However, L480 / N687 assumes an ability to read and comprehend advanced Hebrew literary texts. Readings will consist primarily of representative short stories and a novel. Some selections of poetry, when assigned, will be read in class. The primary purpose of the readings will be to introduce students to the culture of the shtetl, the small east European Jewish hamlet. We will be exploring the way in which literature responds and reflects major historical events in the Jewish experience of the early twentieth century. In that regard, we shall explore the many forces prompting the protagonists' rebellion against that way of life with its insular piety. Yet, having abandoned the ways and values of the shtetl, the youth of those days are depicted as being left with the burden of seeking out new roots and finding a meaning for their lives. Under the phenomenon of this large cultural transformation, as we shall see, Hebrew literature had to contend with and give expression to the most central events and themes of modern times affecting Jewish life: the loss of innocence and tradition in a modern, secular, world; nationalism; the Holocaust; the rebirth of Israel; wars, peace and the individual; the image of the new Israeli.

    :description: What is it to think about the world rationally? And why are people so often so bad at doing it? This course has four distinct, but closely related parts, aimed at answering those questions. First, we have some philosophical preliminaries about whether it even makes sense to distinguish rational from irrational ways of thinking, and try to defend rationality from skeptical and relativistic attacks. We will then look at the tools of formal logic to develop a framework for evaluating arguments as deductively rational (or not); and then, since logic is only a part of rationality, we will also develop a framework for scientific reasoning about the empirical world. Finally, armed with these accounts of logical and scientific reasoning, we will turn to the psychology of human reasoning, and examine a number of experimental results that seem to show the limits of human cognition, and some particular foibles of reasoning that we may all be susceptible to.

We shall find that, although Kierkegaard was a dedicated Christian whereas Sartre was a confirmed atheist, in many respects their views are quite similar. Class will meet in lecture format twice a week, plus a required discussion section on Fridays. There will be regularly scheduled short quizzes throughout the semester, to make sure you are getting the terminology and basic concepts. In addition, students will be required to write two examinations and two papers. Required Textbooks: (1) Robert Bretall, *A Kierkegaard Anthology* (Princeton). (2) Soren Kierkegaard, *Fear and Trembling* (Penguin). (3) Walter Kaufmann, ed., *Existentialism from Dostoevsky to Sartre* (2nd ed.) (Meridian). (4) Jean-Paul Sartre, *Nausea*."

    :description: "Ethics is the branch of philosophy dedicated to investigating several questions, including: How should I live? How should I act? What sorts of acts are prohibited and what sort of behaviors ought I to cultivate in my life? While these are broad topics, they serve as a guide to investigating what particular philosophers have said concerning these issues. In this class we will read a variety of different philosophical attempts to answer these questions. We will look at virtue ethics, utilitarianism, and deontology as well as many other topics such as cultural relativism, hedonism, and atheistic ethics. After taking this course, students will be familiar with several major ethical theories but they will have also gained something more: the ability to critically think about and evaluate their own preconceived notions about morality and life in general."

    :description: "We may often reflect on the moral questions in life, such as the following: How ought I to act? What sort of habits should I strive to develop? How can I determine which actions are right and which are wrong? What makes actions good or bad? Which goals are worth pursuing in life? What moral duties do I owe to myself and my fellow persons? Are there any objective moral values, or are they \x93just relative\x94? Such questions might be thought amongst the deepest challenges we face in life, as their answers seem both staggeringly important and yet constantly out of grasp. Ethics is the branch of philosophy which investigates such questions. As a branch of philosophy, ethics approaches these questions with precision and rigor. This course will explore the ethical thought of some of history\x92s most profound and exacting thinkers, including Plato, Aristotle, Bentham, Mill, Kant, and Nietzsche. We will also consider the relevance of their theories to contemporary moral problems. The coursework will involve weekly Oncourse reading quizzes, essay tests, and a final paper, with special emphasis on the clarity and thoroughness of written work."

    :description: "Ethics is the branch of philosophy concerned with the question of how to live. Revolving around that question is a cluster of other questions central to ethics: What is good? What is right? What is morally permitted, required, or prohibited? And what is it that determines whether certain actions are morally right or morally wrong? In this class, we will consider how some ethical theories construct answers to these questions. Divine Command Theory, for example, claims that morality issues from God\x92s commands. Moral relativism, as the name suggests, claims that moral evaluations are true or false only relative to some evaluator or some cultural standard. We will scrutinize these claims. We will then delve into the two most dominant modern ethical theories, Utilitarianism and Kantian Ethics. If time allows, we will look at an alternative tradition rooted in the work of Aristotle, a view known as Virtue Ethics. We will also periodically use these theoretical frameworks to examine some real life ethical problems. Ethical problems we will consider include the following: Are we ever morally permitted or morally required to lie? Are we morally required to give money to the disadvantaged? Are we ever morally permitted or morally required to kill the innocent? Are we ever morally permitted to end our own lives at a time of our choosing? This is a philosophy course, and, although no prior experience with philosophy is required, you should be aware that we will be doing close and critical reading of challenging (and fascinating!) philosophical texts. You will be graded on the basis of attendance and participation, weekly quizzes, 3 short writing assignments, and a midterm and final exam. The readings will be drawn mostly from Ethics: History, Theory, and Contemporary Issues, Eds. Steven M. Cahn and Peter Markie.

If that is correct then one must be unethical in order to be a successful business person. Others argue that the only justifiable goal a business person can have is to maximize profit. If that is right then the only way to be an ethical business person is to try to be a successful one. In this course you will learn ways to evaluate the ethical legitimacy of business models and practices. For instance, you will learn how to answer the following questions. Is pursuing profit maximization legitimate per se? What ethical obligations does one have to one\x92s clients or customers? If one is managing someone else\x92s business, what ethical obligations does one have to the owner? What lengths should one go to avoid groupthink and self- deception in one\x92s business decisions? In business communications, what is the difference between positive spin and misleading rhetoric? What is the difference between a business strategy that is merely bold and one that is unethical? How much responsibility does the individual have for a collective decision? How does one do what one is told without selling one\x92s soul? You will have weekly reading assignments and take a weekly quiz over them. You will also have two exams and a final paper. Readings for the course include articles by Marcia Baron, Albert Carr, W. K.

    :description: "This course is about the origins of Western philosophy in ancient Greece. The two and a half centuries from Anaximander, the first Greek thinker whose work we know much about, to the death of Aristotle, roughly from 586 B.C.E. to 323 B.C.E., constitute an exciting and foundational period in Western culture. It is the time of the growth of the Greek city states, of the ascendancy of Athens and Athenian culture, of the emergence of tragic drama, of developments in natural philosophy and mathematics, of the flourishing of rhetoric, and much else. In this course we will study the great thinkers of the period, from the Ionian physical thinkers, to Parmenides and Heraclitus, the Sophists, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. We will examine in detail the fragmentary remains of the earliest thinkers and selections from many of Plato's dialogues; if time permits, we shall discuss the development of Aristotle's thought. The major focus of the class will be on using the texts we have to understand each thinker, his place in the tradition of Greek thinking, and the ways in which his thought tries to deal with a variety of issues \x96 about inquiry and knowledge, morality, reality and the everyday world, religion, language, and art. At the same time, we shall try to trace some central themes about knowledge and reality as they develop throughout the tradition, from the early physical thinkers to Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle. Requirements: Students will receive a detailed syllabus with reading assignments. Of primary importance will be the study of the texts, and in class we shall spend a good deal of time reading and examining them. In addition to studying the texts and preparing for class, members of the class will be evaluated on the basis of a short written assignment, a mid-term, a final examination, a term essay, and a reading project on a chunk from a Platonic dialogue. There will be several optional discussions during the semester, and students will be encouraged to communicate by e-mail as they work on the material and have questions or comments."

    :description: Modern Jewish Philosophy begins in the seventeenth century, when attempts to understand Judaism were challenged by historical and intellectual developments, such as the rise of the New Science, the emergence of new modes of political thinking and practices, and the growth of Protestant cultures in Europe. What makes such reflection about Judaism philosophical is its engagement with the Western philosophical tradition. Central figures are Baruch Spinoza in the 17th century and Moses Mendelssohn in the 18th, the former of whom was deeply committed to Cartesian philosophy and the latter to Enlightenment rationalism. Although they reflected upon Judaism for different reasons and with different attitudes, both sought to negotiate the relationship between Judaism and philosophical thought. The same can be said of the major figures in the tradition of Jewish philosophy in the twentieth century. In this course, we will focus on them and the worlds in which they lived and worked. First, we will look at European intellectual culture in the period between 1890 and 1940 by discussing some prominent philosophers, theologians, social thinkers, novelists, and poets of the period. We will then study central Jewish philosophical figures of the period, especially Hermann Cohen, Martin Buber, and Franz Rosenzweig.

    :description: Does this conclusion follow from those premises?" This seems to be a question which calls upon us to exercise our imaginative powers. To determine the answer, our only option seems to be to try to imagine circumstances under which the premises come out true and the conclusion comes out false. If (and only if) we find no such circumstance imaginable, should we conclude that the answer is "Yes"? But what a risky procedure this is! After all, the mere fact that we haven't been able to imagine a circumstance under which the premises come out true and the conclusion comes out false does not mean that there is no such circumstance. How can we know that we haven't simply overlooked the crucial circumstance? The central aim of this course is to show that there is a better - and very different way to go about answering the question. We will see that a significant portion of English discourse exhibits a structure that enables it to be translated into a purely symbolic language. And we will see that, once premises and conclusion are translated into a purely symbolic language, the question, "Does this conclusion follow from these premises?," can be decisively answered by a technique which involves nothing more than the manipulation of symbols according to precise rules.

    :description: "A deductive argument is valid just in case it is not possible for all its premises to be true while the conclusion is false. But how can we tell when we have exhaustively surveyed all possibilities? It may seem that we can never be quite sure\x97there are too many possibilities to check. The task of this logic course is to develop a general technique for evaluating deductive arguments. The first step involves the use of a formal language for expressing the underlying logical structure of a broad range of English sentences. The next step is to introduce a variety of techniques for evaluating formal arguments, including truth tables and deductions. Once an English argument is translated into the formal language, formal techniques can be to solve the apparently informal problem with which we began, i.e., the problem of finding out whether it is possible for the conclusion of the argument to be false while all its premises are true. There will be weekly graded homework, 2 mid-term examinations and a final examination."

    :description: Minds, it seems, are very strange things. They seem to be _somehow_ related to the physical world, but nonetheless are not easily explained in purely physical terms. They have the unusual property of being _about_ other things, or having other things as their meanings, even when those things don't exist. (Think of a pink elephant. On the one hand, this is easily done ... and yet, on the other hand, how is it something you could do at all, given that there are no such things as pink elephants? If I were to ask you to stand next to a pink elephant, the instruction would be impossible to comply with. And yet somehow our minds can reach out into the void....) And minds have subjectivity and consciousness -- there is something that it is like to be a mind, a point of view on the world, which is something that perhaps no other objects in the world have. This course will cover many of the main theories and arguments about trying to solve these many challenging facets of the mind-body problem. We will do so almost entirely by reading the primary literature of philosophy articles that have been written by philosophers and for philosophers, by such authors as Descartes, Hilary Putnam, Jerry Fodor, Daniel Dennett, Alan Turing, Ned Block, and David Chalmers. Also, students will be required to produce a large number of short writing assignments that engage with the arguments of these articles. So this course is best suited for students who are already fairly comfortable reading, thinking, and discussing substantive philosophy texts.

You\x92ve never given it much thought, don\x92t understand it, never heard of it, much less care about it? Well then, lucky you! You still have that ahead of you! Have you never worried just a little how to become yourself? No? Oh, are you in for a treat! Here is an advanced undergraduate/graduate course on S\xF8ren Kierkegaard, designed to introduce you to all these wonders. We\x92ll go well beyond the standard \x93package\x94-presentation you may have heard before (may in fact have heard from me). You\x92ll inevitably be amazed by what\x92s really going on, surely baffled, probably intrigued, perhaps attracted, maybe offended -\x97 possibly even outraged. But, make no mistake, you\x92ve never seen anything like it. Kierkegaard was a prolific writer, and we can only scratch the surface. But it will be a deep scratch, and will draw blood. We\x92ll read all of his Fear and Trembling and Sickness unto Death, as well as generous extracts from Either/Or and portions of several other major and lesser works of his, including The Concept of Anxiety. Topics will include things like: the nature of a self, how to choose how to live, the role of factual \x93evidence\x94 in that choice, time and \x93eternity,\x94 the relation between ethics and religion, the notion of guilt and especially collective guilt for things you didn\x92t personally do \x97 and on and on! Students will write a series of weekly quizzes over details and factual background, two essay-type examinations, and a full- dress term paper consisting of a philosophical commentary on some text or extended passage from Kierkegaard. (I\x92ll suggest lots of possibilities and refer you to appropriate supplementary sources.) This is an \x93advanced undergraduate/graduate\x94 class. If you are an undergraduate, it is intended as a capstone to your studies in philosophy at IU. It will be an \x93advanced\x94 course, and will presuppose philosophical background. Novices who are simply attracted by cool things and lack appropriate preparation won\x92t last two weeks. I\x92ll presuppose no special knowledge of Kierkegaard, but will certainly assume some philosophical training. (If in doubt about your qualifications, by all means ask me.) If you are a graduate student, chances are you nevertheless won\x92t have had a lot of background in Kierkegaard, and so won\x92t have much of an unfair advantage. If enough graduate students enroll, I\x92ll arrange occasional meetings with them separately for additional readings in greater depth. Step right up, ladies and gentlemen! For the price of a mere three hours of tuition, learn \x93the difference between a genius and an apostle\x94! Required texts: * Susan Leigh Anderson, On Kierkegaard (Wadsworth). For a quick overview. * Robert Bretall, ed. A Kierkegaard Anthology (Princeton). * S\xF8ren Kierkegaard, Fear and Trembling, Hannay trans. (Penguin). * S\xF8ren Kierkegaard, The Concept of Anxiety, Thomte trans. (Princeton). * S\xF8ren Kierkegaard, The Sickness unto Death, Hannay trans. (Penguin). Other recommended and required readings will be placed on Ereserves or on \"physical\" resereve in the main library. NOTE: Don't be discouraged by the gloomy-sounding titles of some of Kierkegaard's works. He also tells us about the \"joy\" there is in the idea that in relation to God we are always in the wrong!"

    :description: "Topic: Epistemology and the Demands of Philosophy What relation does an epistemology have to bear to our ordinary practices\x97to what we say and do in ordinary life? Descartes famously argued that the right answer is, \x93Not much.\x94 He argued that the right way to fashion an epistemology requires standing back from ordinary practice and, from a philosophical distance, assessing the adequacy of what we ordinarily say and do. We must (he thought) open ourselves to the possibility that, from this distance, some (perhaps, even most) of what we say and do in ordinary life will be found wanting. This idea is still very much alive in epistemology, and not just among epistemologists who take seriously the skeptical worries that Descartes made so famous. The thought is that there are things we want from epistemology that we simply cannot expect to get unless we take philosophical distance from ordinary practice. Amongst the things we want (the thought goes) is a theory that is general, that is suitably simple, that makes no important distinction without providing necessary and sufficient conditions for something\x92s falling on one side, rather than another, of the distinction. We also want a theory that fits well with our picture of our place in the world, whether that picture portrays us as special sorts of creatures (for example, as persons operating in the space of reasons), or portrays us as just one species of animal among many, eking out our living in a manner that is in no really important way different from the way other animals do, or portrays us in some other way. And we want a theory that recognizes that pragmatic considerations influence what we are willing to say in ordinary life, so that what is true to say in a given circumstance will not always coincide with what we are willing to say in that circumstance. Unless we take a position of philosophical distance from ordinary practice (the thought is), nothing like the sort of theory we want is going to be available. J. L. Austin, the avatar of the \x93ordinary language\x94 approach to philosophy that was prominent in the middle years of the last century, had a different view. He thought that an epistemology, to be worth its salt, has to be scrupulously faithful to our ordinary practices. It is this radical proposal (what it is supposed to mean, how it could possibly carry conviction, what kind of contribution an epistemology could possibly be expected to make under the methodological constraint the proposal would impose) that we will be examining and evaluating. Of course, one does not evaluate a proposal in isolation from others that are available. So this attempt to see what sense we can make of Austin\x92s proposal will take us on something of a tour of the ways others have conceived of the methodology of epistemology (including how, from their point of view, Austin\x92s conception might be criticized). Our itinerary will have us stopping to take a critical look at intuition-based methodologies, a number of naturalist methodologies, along with methodologies that provide a comfortable environment for skeptical worries of the Cartesian sort. For purposes of comparing and contrasting methodologies and epistemologies, we will focus primarily on that part of epistemology that attempts to say something about the nature and extent of our knowledge of the world around us."

    :credit: ""
    :description: A democracy with an uninformed citizenry is simply an oligarchy in which those who understand the political process gain power over those who do not. The purpose of this course is to provide students a foundation for understanding the mechanics of the American government and politics. We will focus on the rules (the Constitution) and institutions of government - the Presidency, Congress, the Supreme Court, political parties, and elections - with the intention of each student completing the course prepared to be an active participant in civic life. Lastly, we will look at the historical development of government and politics in America from the founding to the present. This course is appropriate, or perhaps even more important, for students who are not majoring in Political Science. The material we will cover constitutes "the basics" that students in fields such as history, sociology, journalism, business, or public affairs need to succeed. More importantly, this course will prepare students to understand and critically analyze the daily media barrage of information about what goes on in Washington. The course is designed to accommodate majors, non-majors, and undecided students who may be considering Political Science. Due to the brevity of the summer session, regular attendance will be essential and expected. Grading will be based on an exam and several short (2-4 pages) writing assignments.

    :description: "This course provides an introduction to political philosophy by addressing some of the most fundamental questions of political life. Should we obey government? Which form of government is best, and why? What is justice? How should we envision the relationship between morality and politics? After completing this course, you will have gained 1) a preliminary overview of the history of western political ideas and 2) improved skills in thinking and writing about politics with clarity and precision. The course offers an introduction to a rich variety of competing political philosophies: liberalism, democracy, socialism, feminism, as well as contemporary free-market conservativism. Texts from a broad range of classical writers, extending from Plato to Marx, will be read. Some contemporary writers, including Albert Einstein and Friedrich Hayek, are also examined. Completion of two midterm exams, one final exam, and one 6-7 pp. essay, is required. Class attendance is compulsory, and participation is strongly encouraged."
  - :name: Intro to Comparative Politics
    :number: Y107 20063
    :subject: POLS
    :credit: "0"
    :description: "Comparative politics is the branch of political science that studies the similarities and differences across different political regimes. The subfield is organized around three major questions: why some countries democracies and others are not, why some countries are rich while others are poor, and why some countries engage in or experience conflict when others do not. Each of these broad questions yields a larger number of issues and puzzles that need to be addressed. For example, if we think about contemporary politics we might ask why sectarian violence has intensified in Iraq or why democracy has suffered setbacks in Afghanistan and what the international community might do to improve those situations. In this class, you will be doing comparative politics. The class is divided into four sections. The first section will outline the tools that political scientists have developed in order to answer their questions. The second section outlines the similarities and differences across a range of political regimes that have been observed in the world. The third section will address the political mechanisms that make resource rich states prone to authoritarianism. This question is crucial for contemporary politics as we observe the failure of democracy in Russia, Nigeria and Venezuela. The final section of the class will address a key puzzle in electoral politics: why do people vote and why has political turnout declined across the world\x92s democracies in the past two decades?"

    :description: "Meets with NELC N204 This course introduces you to the interaction among people, governments and outside powers in the greater Middle East and North Africa--a vast and complex area that stretches from Morocco to Iran, and from Turkey to the Sudan. Scholars differ in how they name this large area and its different sub-regions, but we\x92ll call it the MENA (Middle East & North Africa) region for our purposes, and include neighboring Afghanistan for convenience. Topics addressed include much of the following: Background (geography, history, culture and religion); the colonial legacy; the influence of the global configuration of power on international relations in the Middle East: the Cold War and post Cold War eras; hegemony, cooption and challengers; the role of resources; OPEC; the role of non-state organizations; gender issues; the role of identity and ideology; role of diasporas; the Arab-Israeli conflict; Zionism and the Palestinian predicament; the Iraq-Iran War; the Gulf Wars; weapons of mass destruction and other tools for the projection of power in the region; transnational movements; international dimensions of religion, ethnicity, and civil wars; state and religion in the Middle East; the effect of the flow of goods, people and services on Middle Eastern states; the \"Arab street\"; security issues; return to colonialism?; war in Iraq and Afghanistan; prospects for the future."

  - :name: Analyzing Politics
    :number: Y205 26788
    :subject: POLS

    :description: "This course is designed to be an introduction to the tools and skills necessary to analyze politics. The skills discussed and practiced would be valuable to anyone considering a major in political science (or other social science disciplines), future profession in law, business, policy research, or community advocacy to name a few possibilities. It is equally designed for those students who may not have decided their future directions but are interested in being critical consumers of the news media, political advertising, and other sources of political information. We will be discussing such issues as: what is the nature of a hypothesis; how to understand causation; the role of comparison in political analysis; how to understand, interpret, and collect political information through polls and surveys, focus groups, in-depth interviews, ethnographic observation, and experimental research; and, how to interpret and present information presented in charts, graphs, tables, and visual maps. In order to learn about sometimes abstract concepts and skills, we will focus on a variety of \x93hot\x94 policy issues and debates. Some of the topics will include: the role of race in the response to Hurricane Katrina; the plight of the uninsured in America; the trend toward college-educated women leaving the work world to raise their children; and, how NASA knew but did not recognize the problems with the space shuttle before it crashed. The course will involve regular in-class participation by students in small and large-group discussions as well as in-class activities where we \x93practice what we preach.\x94 The requirements will thus include: active attendance and participation; three short (5-7 page) take-home research design, data collection and/or data analysis assignments; and, a mid-term and final exam."

    :credit: ""
    :description: "Contrary to most people\x92s expectations, the end of the Cold War has not eliminated the threat to national and planetary survival posed by nuclear weapons. Both the US and Russia retain huge arsenals, which both sides are working hard to modernize. A growing number of other states are acquiring arsenals of their own. In the meantime, the collapse of the Soviet Union is accelerating the process of nuclear proliferation and increasing the danger of nuclear war from an accident or detonation by terrorists. At the same time, the two nuclear superpowers are faced with serious environmental damage and substantial risks resulting from the production and storage of nuclear warheads and fuel. This course will examine the key decisions over the last 60 years by policy makers in the US, the USSR/Russia, Europe, and the Third World that created this dangerous situation, the contemporary consequences of these decisions, and the prospects for the future. We will consider the options open to decision makers in the past and the present, the wisdom of and rationale for the choices they made, and what should be done now. The course will be taught as a seminar, meeting two hours a week and emphasizing discussion. Weekly reading will be 50-60 pages, including many original source documents (memoirs, letters, speeches) and news articles from the past and present, as well as scholars\x92 discussions of the issues. Writing assignments will total approximately 20-25 pages. There will be a midterm and a final."

    :description: "This course explores the intersection of constitutional theory and the politics of interpreting the American Constitution. At its most abstract, the course addresses two broad questions. First, what kind of a thing is a constitution? Second, how -- if at all -- can written constitutions shape and maintain polities? To get at these theoretical issues, we will move back and forth between constitutional theory and three problems basic to the study of the American constitutional enterprise: WHAT is the American Constitution, WHO are its authoritative interpreters, and HOW should we interpret the Constitution? By moving back and forth between constitutional theory and law, we will explore the nature of both constitutions in general and the Constitution of the United States in particular."

Either trend has critical implications for the rest of the world. A strong Chinese state, for better or worse, will have greater influence over its neighbors and in international institutions. A weak Chinese state will not be able to sustain economic growth, protect the environment, or manage disputes among conflicting interests, with clear negative spillover effects for the world. This broad question will be considered through a discussion of four topics: 1) trends and patterns in elite politics; 2) the evolving nature of the policymaking process; 3) political activism of average Chinese; and 4) the relative likelihood of continued Communist Party rule, democratization, or collapse in the near future. To better understand China, we will regularly make comparisons with politics elsewhere. We use secondary readings by outside observers, primary documents by political insiders, media reports, and film documentaries. No previous study of Chinese history or politics or knowledge of the Chinese language is required."

It is designed to introduce you to a variety of different aspects of European political culture, political parties, interest groups, political institutions. European integregation, and new social movements. The goals of this course are threefold. First, you should learn in some detail about three countries which we will focus on: France, Germany, and Great Britain. Secondly, you should learn to evaluate some important theories about politics. And last, you should learn to think rigorously and comparatively about politics. Comparative thinking is an extremely useful analytical tool and we will frequently employ this method in the course to demonstrate its utility. The required readings are drawn from four books which cover the three countries. The reading load averages about 100 pages a week. Course requirements include a midterm exam, a final exam, and a term paper. Exams typically consist of a combination of several identifications and a longer essay question."

    :description: "The breach of the Berlin Wall in 1989 brought forth a new political euphoria: peace and democracy in the world were the expected outcomes. But reality proved harsher. In the years since these dramatic events, East Europe witnessed a bloody war in the Balkans, the revival of ethnic and national hate in the region, and the return of former communist parties to power through free elections. How are we to explain these events? We consider the question by looking at the communist and post-communist attempts at building new societies in East Europe in the post-WW II era. The region has been often an arena of human experimentation, of the rise and fall of grand political projects. The inter-war attempt at \"self- determination\" culminated in the rise of national conflicts and authoritarianism. The post-WW II \"communist\" vision of economic abundance and political harmony gave way to economic shortages and political cleavages. Since the 1989 Revolutions, market economies and democratic polities are the new dream. Is this the future of East Europe, or will the emerging problems lead anew to national conflicts, authoritarian politics, and economic decline? These issues are examined through the communist and post-communist attempts at building new societies in East Europe. The first part of the course looks at the background to and the establishment of communism in Eastern Europe, and at the major crises faced by communist states and their final breakdown during the \"revolutions of 1989.\" The second half of the course looks at contemporary issues of the transition from communism to democracy."

The primary purpose of this course is to enhance students' understanding of the ways in which two contradictory but contemporaneous developments of convergence and divergence occur in the international politics of modern times. At the same time that the world is becoming a smaller, more interconnected place, people are stressing the differences between them more and more. What is globalization and why is it occurring? In order to answer this basic question, we will spend significant time covering changes in international finance and international economics. How and to what extent has it changed international politics? What are its effects? What is the relationship between globalization and identity politics? This course will analyze the winners and losers of globalization, study the emerging threats posed by both globalization and identity politics, and identify and evaluate possible ways to address these problems.

States often act in highly puzzling ways in world politics. This course will help you understand why they do so. It will examine some of the many factors that influence foreign policy behavior: the impact of individual leaders and personalities; the circumstances under which decisions are made; individual and collective perceptions and misperceptions; national values, beliefs and experiences; institutional structures and processes; and political and socio-economic systems. A role- playing exercise at the end of the semester will give students an opportunity to apply what they have learned in simulating the behavior of foreign policy decision makers.

First, which morally problematic means are justified in pursuing valuable political ends? Second, what should the ends of public policy be? Third, what are the moral responsibilities of public officials when they try to answer the first two questions? We will begin each topic by evaluating the theory on its own terms. We will then apply the principles derived from ethical theory to concrete cases in public policy. We will also use the cases to test the adequacy of the ethical theory. Among the topics we will discuss are political violence, political deception, social experiments, cost-benefit analysis, organ transplants, commercial surrogacy, religion and public education, public funding for abortion, affirmative action, gay marriage, and political responsibility. Each student will be responsible for completing one oral presentation (done with a group), one paper, one midterm examination, and one final examination.

    :description: This course explores early American ideas about government and its role in social and economic life. We trace these ideas to their English origins and show how they were adapted by immigrants in New England, mid-Atlantic, and Southern colonies, respectively. These adaptations laid the groundwork for a Declaration of Independence and the exercise of popular sovereignty under the Articles of Confederation. The Constitution of the United States was proposed in reaction to the alleged excesses of majority rule under the Articles, and we will review the ratification debates in detail. We conclude with an assessment of a newly-installed government that was republican in character, but not democratic in form. The course is taught in lecture format. Reading assignments average about 175 pages per week. Grades are based on three essay examinations, and a series of short quizzes or exercises administered via OnCourse.

Individuals who practice the religion or who belong to ethnic groups that are traditionally Muslim are now estimated to make some 2% of the North American population and 4% of the European Union\x92s population, and their numbers are expected to continue to grow. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the wars that followed highlighted and amplified the role and perception of Muslim minorities in the West as political actors and electoral constituencies, subjects of cultural hostility, scapegoats for poor economic performance, suspects in the face of insecurity whose rights could be exceptionally curtailed, and agents for the projection of geopolitical power. Western states and their rapidly growing Muslim populations are adjusting to each other under the constant pressure of exogenous shocks. The way they manage the process will deeply affect Western polities and their relations with the Muslim world. Substantive topics we will explore include: How/why do different states strike a balance between security and civil rights/liberties? Is there really a tradeoff between the two? How do they deal with immigration, both permitted and unregulated? What factors affect the degree of political participation by Western Muslims? Why are culture clashes more salient in some countries than in others? Why do Muslim immigrants prosper more economically in North America than in Europe? How do international conflicts affect the relationship between Western states and their Muslim citizens and the dynamics among citizens of different backgrounds? Is there a connection between Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in the West? Are we witnessing the birth of a Western Muslim macro-ethnicity or many disjointed ethnic communities? How are Muslims perceived in their Western societies and how do they perceive their fellow citizens? What will the future hold? Students are expected to regularly participate in discussions and to write two 5-page papers and a 10-15 page research paper."

    :description: Even relatively simple forms of political participation seem increasingly unpopular in contemporary American democracy. Most of our fellow citizens are at best politically indifferent and at worst disgusted with the operations of existing liberal democracy. How did we reach this state of affairs, and might it be possible to do something about it? The course begins with a careful examination of some the great classics of modern liberal democratic theory (e.g., Alexis de Tocqueville's writings on 19th century American democracy) in order to understand the normative and institutional foundations of our political system. We then turn to a rapidly growing literature suggesting that contemporary liberal democracy is suffering from serious pathologies. Finally, we focus on a panoply of proposals to reform the operations of liberal democracy in order to make sure we do in fact have a political order "of the people, by the people, for the people." Students will be expected to write a rewrite a series of short (5- 6pp) papers, as well as take a midterm and final. Participation and attendance are mandatory.

We will start with basic concepts including attitudes, behavior and cognition. We will discuss what these terms mean and how they interact to shape individual political experience. We will take some time to talk about applications of the experimental method to political phenomena. Focusing on the American political context we will discuss how citizens form opinions about issues and candidates and how they may be subject to persuasion by media outlets and political elites. We will also discuss how elite decision-makers, including judges and world leaders, structure their decision tasks to maximize the influence of \x93expert\x94 knowledge and prevent certain biases. We will see that such efforts are not always successful and discuss what this means in terms of the larger political context in which they are acting. Finally, we will discuss how people come to identify as part of a larger \x93social group,\x94 how they interact based on those identities and the implications for political phenomena including racial and ethnic conflict.

We have three challenging aims: To tease out perspectives and connections often obscured when social science is fixated on the immediate; to provide an interdisciplinary orientation to problem solving; and to raise and attempt to understand the significance of large and contentious issues. I will give a few examples of the questions we will consider: How come peoples in the Americas, Africa and Australia developed patterns of urban \x93civilized\x94 living more slowly and incompletely than did peoples on the Eurasian continent? How did Europe, for most of human history an unimportant appendage of the Eurasian continent, emerge as the dominant world area? Looking to the future, why, if the earth has undergone continuous patterns of warming and cooling, does current \x93global warming\x94 potentially pose such hazards? Or, if our interest is more political, why don\x92t peoples around the world seem to embrace joyously our ideas of liberty and democracy? Or, turning to civil society, how can modern societies such as the United States accommodate diversity and still remain civil? In investigating these issues, we will have the benefit of reading a variety of outstanding works including Ian Buruma, Murder in Amsterdam and Jared Diamond, Guns, Germs and Steel.

It is primarily designed for students in the Joint Ph.D. program in Public Policy, the field of Public Policy in Political Science, or in the Public Affairs Ph.D. program in SPEA. We will examine a wide array of theoretical approaches, including policy stages, policy sciences, incrementalism, institutional analysis based on rational choice theory, public choice, policy networks, advocacy coalitions, punctuated equilibrium, network governance, and discourse analysis. Each student will be asked to complete a voluminous amount of readings in diverse perspectives, with the expectation that each will delve into the details of methods most appropriate for their own research plans in other seminars. Most readings will be analytical or conceptual in focus, but along the way students will get exposed to the details of a few selected areas of substantive policy. In addition to regular memos on course readings, students will submit a seminar paper on a policy topic of their own choosing in which they specify research questions that would be relevant from different theoretical perspectives on a particular topic in public policy. There will also be a final exam, with questions similar to those that tend to be asked on Ph.D. examinations. Many articles will be made available in electronic format, along with a few required texts: Weimer and Vining, Policy Analysis, Sabatier, Theories of the Policy Process, and Goldsmith and Eggers, Governing by Network."

    :description: Y569 is considered the gateway course (A and I) for further study in International Relations. It assumes no previous background in IR, but it also assumes that all students in the course have a professional interest in the development of the subfield. The emphasis throughout is theoretical, as opposed to descriptive, empirical or normative concerns. The study of international relations is cursed or blessed with a wide spectrum of alternative assumptions and frameworks for its study. Surveying this spectrum of choices, and their historical and analytical evolution, is the primary objective of the course. After completing the survey, students cannot expect to be experts in IR theory but, at least, they will have some better-than-average understanding of the theoretical landscape that will serve as one prerequisite to preparing for preliminary exams.

The course is designed to sensitize students to the real differences, methodological and otherwise, that characterize the discipline, but also to the common themes and objects of study shared by political scientists. The course is divided into three parts: (1) an overview of the discipline as a discipline with a distinctive history; (2) an overview of diverse understandings of what it means to study politics \x93scientifically,\x94 and (3) a synthetic discussion of the way different methodological orientations approach a common topic\x97the study of democratic citizenship\x97and the way each of these approaches brings something unique and valuable to the study of politics."

This seminar introduces graduate students to the art and science of research design. We will cover the basic logic of scientific inference, paying particular attention to the key steps of conceptualization, hypothesis-formation, measurement/operationalization, case selection, and interpretation of results. Our focus will remain on the overall logic of research design, rather than on the specific mechanics of any one particular technique. Students should emerge from this seminar with an appreciation of the wide range of approaches to research in political science and public policy, as well as the ability to comparatively evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of different approaches. We will cover the basic logic of experimental and quasi- experimental designs, comparative case studies, and some types of qualitative research. We will read general treatments of the logic of research design as well as specific instances of exemplary design. After completing this course, students should be able to design their own research projects (including their required second- year paper) in a way that insures that, no matter what they find, their findings will constitute a valid contribution to scientific knowledge on their chosen subject. This seminar is primarily designed for second-year students in political science, as part of our newly instituted multi-year program of orientation to the profession of political science. (Other students can be enrolled with permission of the instructor.) Although this course is listed at the same time and place as a section of Y580 taught by Bill Bianco, these two sections will meet on alternate weeks.

While recognizing that public policies affect all people, this course will focus on policies that either directly or indirectly confront the way gender is constructed and maintained. Our primary focus will be on issues such as marriage and civil unions (both heterosexual and same-sex), reproduction (including abortion and reproductive technologies), family/ child policies (including perhaps adoption), soldiering and citizenship (including transgender considerations.) One of our emphases will be on comparing the discursive politics and political opportunity structures across nations for the same set of issues. Why does discourse develop differently, what are the conditions leading to different opportunity structures, and why are outcomes similar or different? The first two-thirds of the seminar will focus on a core set of readings, including both classics such as Skocpol\x92s Protecting Soldier and Mothers and Mansbridge, Why We Lost the ERA, to new studies such as Outshoorn, The Politics of Prostitution: Women's Movements, Democratic States and the Globalization of Sex Commerce (2004), Bernstein & Schaffner, Regulating Sex (2005) and Mazur, Theorizing Feminist Policy (2006). The last third of the semester will provide an opportunity for students to explore other policy areas not covered in the core readings.

    :description: "The seminar examines major issues in the study of elections and party systems in a comparative context. The topic concerns one of the principal themes in the study of political science, as evident in the preponderance of works on elections and parties in the discipline\x92s top journals and monographs. We will read some of the foundational literature in the field (e.g. Duverger, Lipset and Rokkan, Sartori), \x93contemporary\x94 classics (e.g. Lijphart, Taagepera and Shugart,) and current cutting edge research (e.g. Mainwaring, Norris). The seminar\x92s content includes literature relevant to both established democracies and democratizing states. The topics covered in the course begin with a look at the origins of political parties, the institutional design of electoral systems, and parties as organizations, move on to consider such issues as party systems, political competition, electoral volatility, and conclude with questions of parties and representation, and the quality of democracy. In addition, we will examine the development of electoral and party systems in the major regions of the world. Requirements include class participation, critical essays on two weekly topics, and a research paper."

This research is part of the latest installment in the ongoing dialogue between political science and social psychology. We will examine the psychological processes by which citizens form and change their political views, the influence of various environmental factors on public opinion including social interaction, political campaigns and mass media, and the translation of public opinion into political action with special attention given to voters and elections. It has long been alleged, as Donald Kinder states, that Americans are \x93too ignorant, too intolerant, and too unsophisticated to participate wisely or even sensibly in the affairs of politics.\x94 We shall examine this allegation closely and comprehensively with the aim of determining whether the opinions of the public are more a threat or a source of strength to the promise and practice of American democratic life."

    :description: "This section meets with Y657 and G701 The course will examine discursive politics and social movement practices to understand the conditions and processes that lead to gender public policies. While recognizing that public policies affect all people, this course will focus on policies that either directly or indirectly confront the way gender is constructed and maintained. Our primary focus will be on issues such as marriage and civil unions (both heterosexual and same-sex), reproduction (including abortion and reproductive technologies), family/ child policies (including perhaps adoption), soldiering and citizenship (including transgender considerations.) One of our emphases will be on comparing the discursive politics and political opportunity structures across nations for the same set of issues. Why does discourse develop differently, what are the conditions leading to different opportunity structures, and why are outcomes similar or different? The first two-thirds of the seminar will focus on a core set of readings, including both classics such as Skocpol\x92s Protecting Soldier and Mothers and Mansbridge, Why We Lost the ERA, to new studies such as Outshoorn, The Politics of Prostitution: Women's Movements, Democratic States and the Globalization of Sex Commerce (2004), Bernstein & Schaffner, Regulating Sex (2005) and Mazur, Theorizing Feminist Policy (2006). The last third of the semester will provide an opportunity for students to explore other policy areas not covered in the core readings. Readings will be drawn from political science, gender studies, sociology, and policy studies journals, books and edited volumes.

    :description: "Empirical Theory & Methodology: Institutional Analysis & Development: Micro Instructors: Professors Ostrom and Bianco This class meets at 513 N. Park During the fall semester of this year-long course, we provide a brief overview of the literature focusing on the analysis of individual behavior within various types of institutional arrangements. Many of the topics covered here in one week could well be the topic for a full semester's work. Thus, once you have completed the semester, you will have been introduced to a diversity of work, but you will not yet have gained mastery and will need substantial additional study to gain that mastery. For some subjects, we have listed additional readings that you may wish to pursue either during this semester on those topics of particular interest and importance to you or over the coming years. The syllabus for this course is on the Workshop website at: http://www.indiana.edu/~workshop/seminar.html. The assigned readings will be distributed at least one week in advance or be at the IU Bookstore. Graduate students taking the course for credit have three types of assignments. First, each student is expected to write a short (2-5 page) memo to the instructor each week reflecting on what they are currently reading, how they are progressing on their seminar paper, and related topics. These memos are not individually graded, but part of the final grade will be based on class participation, and the faithfulness and quality of the memos will be reflected in this part of the grade. Second, there will be an exam given toward the end of the semester. Third, a final paper is required. Each student will be expected to select either a type of problem (such as that of providing a particular type of public goods or common-pool resource) or a type of decision-making arrangement (such as that of a legislature or market structure) and undertake a micro-analysis of how combinations of rules, the structure of the goods and technology involved, and culture interact to affect the incentives facing individuals and resulting patterns of interactions adopted by individuals in one or a set of closely related situations. The student may focus more on an operational, a collective-choice, or a constitutional-choice level, but the linkage among these levels should be addressed. This is an excellent opportunity to do a research design for a dissertation that applies institutional analysis to a particular problem. Students may wish to do the first draft of a paper that eventually will be submitted for publication. All papers will be presented at a Mini-Conference on December 8 and 10, 2007."

After examining in detail each of these classic texts, we shall then turn our attention to exploring the various ways in which these works have been interpreted by modern theorists (Leo Strauss, Quentin Skinner, Sheldon Wolin, Michael Oakeshott, Isaiah Berlin, William Connolly) and their disciples. Feminist interpretations of the classic texts will be considered. Students will be asked to write a research paper, a review of a recently-published book, and an annotated bibliography."

    :description: "Goals: This is one of the most important classes you can take as an undergraduate in the Social and Behavioral Sciences. During this course, you will learn optimal ways to make predictions and inferences about the future based on information collected in the past. You will learn how to analyze and interpret data for making decisions using sophisticated state of the art computer programs. These skills are important for all types of careers including research, industry, business, and administration. Teaching Method: For the majority of classes, I will present lectures, and the lecture notes can be downloaded from my WWW home page (shown above) before coming to class. Some of the classes will be conducted in a computer laboratory during which we will demonstrate the use of computer programs (SPSS). Finally, you will be given practice exams to help you prepare for the real exams. Course Grade Procedure: Your course grade will be based on your performance on three different parts: Exams, home-works, and class participation. There will be three exams, as indicated on the course schedule below. Each exam will be scored from 0 to 100%, and the overall exam grade will be the average of the three exams. There will be periodic homework assignments, due as they are announced in class. Late home- works are not accepted without a medical excuse. The overall homework grade will be the average of all the individual home- works. The final grade will be computed from the formula Final = (.75)Exam + (.25)Home. The following cutoffs will be used to assign grades: 100 to 90 = A, 80 to 89 =B, 70 to 79 = C, 60 to 69 =D, below 60 = F."

The course also introduces students to the assessment and treatment of some disorders. Different theories of psychological disorders will be reviewed, with a discussion of the differing explanations of the nature and origins of disorders and of the differing theoretical proposals for preventing and treating disorders. The focus, however, is on empirically validated theories and interventions. Thus, discussion is focused on knowledge that has been gained from psychological research on each disorder, rather than on theories that have not received empirical support. In this context, issues related to research methodology are also discussed. Format: Lecture, covering text material and additional material for which students are responsible. When appropriate, additional materials(e.g., videotapes, case examples, and guest lectures) will be used. Grading: To be determined. Based primarily on exams. Sometimes also extra credit quizzes.

There are no texts and courses are just beginning to emerge. In this course, readings will consist of original research papers, reviews and tutorial chapters written by the experts. The approach will be as \x93hands on\x94 as possible. Class sessions will consist of demonstrations, discussions and lectures. Grading will be based on class participation and on essay exams including a final. In the course, we cover research on perceptually guided actions like walking and running, throwing and catching. We study how a person can walk down a crowded hallway without bumping into other people, that is, how a moving observer generates optic flow that is used to identify and avoid obstacles. We record optical flow with a video camera and analyze the patterns that result. How do you catch a fly ball? When the optic flow is analyzed, it is not what you might think. We will see how actions are geared to the flow of optical information both in robots and in people. How do we move to the places to which perception guides us? How do we coordinate and control our limbs to carry us around or to catch and to throw a ball? We will examine theories of coordination and control and review the neurophysiological organization underlying perception and the neuro- and muscular physiology of movement. Philosophical differences among approaches to perception and action will be discussed."

    :description: "Course Description: This course explores the biological and cellular bases of our experience and behavior. Many scientific disciplines contribute to this theme, so we will draw upon the research of psychologists, anatomists, biochemists, biophysicists, endocrinologists, geneticists, immunologists, neurologists, physiologists, and zoologists. To obtain an integrative view of the relationships between the body, brain, and mind we will combine the findings and insights from the above disciplines, and of necessity try to rise above the limits of any particular specialty. This course is organized into five units, each focusing on a major area of contemporary neuroscience. These units are: 1) Neural Signaling: Basic Neuroanatomy and Principles of Communication and Information Processing, 2) Sensation and Sensory Processing, 3) Movement and Its Central Control, 4) The Changing Brain, 5) Complex Brain Functions: The Neural Bases of Cognition, Language, Emotions, Sex & Sexuality, Learning and Memory. Prerequisites: Psychology P101 or P151 or P106 and one of the following: Psychology 201 (Introduction to Neuroscience), Biology L100 or L111, L112, ANAT A215, PHSL P215 or equivalent.

    :description: "Description: The Bulletin summarizes the course as, \x93A survey of major behavior disorders, with emphasis on empirical research and clinical description relative to etiology, assessment, prognosis, and treatment.\x94 We will take a developmental perspective toward understanding child and adolescent disorders, considering how biological, psychological, and social processes join to produce behavior problems versus positive adaptations. We will consider both standard, diagnostic category systems and dimensional taxonomies of behavioral disorders. We will discuss research on the development of externalizing behavior problems (such as conduct problems and attention problems), internalizing problems (such as anxiety and depression), and developmental disorders (such as autism). We will also discuss scientific and clinical methods and clinical cases. The field of developmental psychopathology research, which informs this course, is exciting and vigorous. Researchers are trying to advance understanding of processes that are of great importance to society. If we can understand how behavior disorders develop, we are more likely to be able to effectively prevent and treat these disorders, and to help children to grow in positive ways. Format: Lecture and discussion. Some discussions will be focused on particular activities, e.g., analyzing a particular case study or research article. Some videos will be shown. Instructor: The professor, John E. Bates, Ph.D., has conducted research on the development of child and adolescent behavior problems. He is especially interested in how children\x92s individual, biologically- based characteristics, such as temperament, predict common behavior problems in interaction with environmental factors, such as parenting qualities. His longitudinal research has followed children and their families from very early in childhood to early adulthood. He has also provided treatment and consultation for families and schools dealing with child and adolescent problems. His main clinical interest is in treatment of young children\x92s oppositional disorders. Dr. Bates has led developmental psychopathology seminars at both the advanced undergraduate and graduate levels, as well as child therapy practicum for advanced graduate students. He has also taught undergraduate courses in abnormal psychology and in behavior therapy. Dr. Bates will offer regular office hours and appointments. And he will be available by email (batesj@indiana.edu) or phone (5- 8693). He encourages students to come and chat, whether they are doing well or having difficulties with the material, whether they are intrigued by something or experiencing boredom. Student Workload: Students will be expected to read large portions of a high- level textbook (Mash & Wolfe, Abnormal Child Psychology, 3rd Ed., Wadsworth, 608 pp.). There will also be some additional reading of journal articles and case studies. Students will be expected to master both text and lecture material. The two sets of material will substantially, but not completely overlap. Mastery will be assessed primarily by exams. There will be two midterms and a final. Expectations will be rigorous\x97that is, there will be some challenging questions. Some of the questions may concern things that are in reading but not lecture material and vice versa. The standard expectation is that students will spend at least 6 hours per week preparing for class and reviewing class notes, including reading. Students will also be expected to participate regularly (part of the grade will be based on daily attendance and various kinds of contributions during lectures and class discussions). The grade for the course will be based on the sum of the student\x92s test scores and the participation bonus. The sum of the test scores will be considered in relation to the distribution of the whole class. Based on past experience, at least 40% will earn A\x92s and B\x92s; and if overall class effort and performance are excellent, then the percentage of top grades will be higher than this."

The student and their research sponsor will bear the main responsibility for the research, but this class will provide both an administrative structure as well as an opportunity to present, discuss, and refine each student's research project. The research sponsor will help the student select a project that has scientific merit and can be completed given the available time and resources. However, students must take the major initiative in developing the background for the project, designing it, collecting, analyzing, and interpreting the data, and preparing the research presentations and the written honors thesis. Class will meet only on prearranged days at the scheduled time. At those meetings, students will make oral presentations of their research projects, or submit sponsor-approved drafts of sections of the prospective thesis on scheduled dates. A poster presentation of the completed research project will also be required. When the thesis reaches its final form, the student will defend it orally before a committee including the research sponsor, and two other faculty members. Once successfully defended, bound copies of the thesis are required for the Psychology Department and the Honors Division. Grading: Most students take the two semesters of P499 for 3 to 6 credits per semester, for a maximum of 12 total credit hours. A grade of \"R\" (grade deferred) will be assigned for each semester until the thesis is completed and defended. When the student's committee accepts the thesis, the \"R\" will be converted to a letter grade, which will depend on the completion of class requirements, sponsor's evaluation, and research presentation.

This course will begin with what is considered the optimal way of making choices \x96 expected utility theory -- which prescribes how to combine beliefs with values. The synthesis expected utility with Bayesian inference produces the well known signal detection model of decision making. However, the signal detection model is a static model, and its dynamic extension is known as the random walk or diffusion model of decision making. Random walk/diffusion models have been used to model decisions ranging from sensation, perception, memory, categorization, and even consumer preferences. Artificial neural network models of choice can be viewed as nonlinear extensions of diffusion models. This course will link together all of these theories, describe how to use these models to explain data, and review empirical for and against these theories."

Likely, the Law School clinic will refer to our clinic couples with children who are having difficulty with the divorce mediation process and who thus might benefit from different, new, or more intensive interventions. Our practicum will focus on identifying and using such interventions. Other options will include modifying existing interventions or developing new interventions. The practicum class will also focus on gathering data to examine the efficacy of any of the interventions we use. This class requires flexibility as students will be exposed to the process of identifying, trying, and testing new interventions for difficult cases.

We will read texts and secondary literature from the three traditions chronologically, beginning with essays on the Hebrew Bible and the targumin (Aramaic translations of the Hebrew Bible). We will then move to Pauline and early rabbinic literature, later rabbinic and Patristic literature, and medieval Jewish philosophical and Christian scholastic material. We will then survey some classical and more modern Muslim literature on this episode. We will conclude with Soren Kierkegaard\x92s use of this biblical motif as the foundation for modern existentialist thought and compare it with modern interpretations of the Akedah in contemporary Jewish philosophy. We will use Genesis 22 as an occasion to talk about Jewish, Christian and Muslim methods of exegesis as well as more general issues and methods in comparative religion. The hope is that this course will serve to widen the students understanding of her own religious tradition in light of and in spite of another tradition that shares its Scripture.

We begin by examining basic methods and tools in ethics, after which we will examine six topics: abortion; war and peace; death and dying in medicine; economic justice; discrimination; and environmental ethics. The chief goal of the course is to explore the complexity of these topics and to understand how religious thought, belief, and practice inform moral discussion in American public life today. Along the way, we ill ask whether individuals or groups have a responsibility to protect the interests of vulnerable, or \x93at-risk\x94 populations: fetuses, political communities under attack, women in the economic and cultural marketplace, sick and dying patients, the poor, racial minorities, and nonhuman lives. These groups, and the issues that surround their needs, stand at the center of debates in public culture today. With each topic we will examine different arguments and points of view. We will close the semester by studying some religious themes that inform most of the readings, focusing on creation and covenant.

    :description: "This course provides an introduction to the varieties of thought about food and sex in early Christianity, beginning with the New Testament in the first and second centuries and tracing vectors of thought into the sixth century. Our primary focus will be the renunciation of food and sex in this period, but will also be how food and sex functioned as the locus of controversy. Why did ancient Christians fast or impose celibacy on themselves? Why did they differ in the degree of imposition? Why was renunciation of food and sex seen in some circles as the \x93best\x94 way to be a Christian? What was at stake in controversies over food and sex? This course will attend to such questions by engaging in a chronological survey of the varieties of both informal and institutionalized attitudes toward food and sex in early Christianity and by examining the ways that ancient Christians lived out their thought on the matter. This topic will bring us into dialogue with ancient psychology, physiology, medicine, cosmology, soteriology, ecclesiology, martyrology, and scriptural interpretation. While a basic understanding of late antique social and ecclesiastical history is helpful, no previous knowledge of Greco-Roman, Jewish or Christian material is assumed."

Deep Ecology is one response to global problems. It seeks fundamental transformations in our views of world and self, claiming that there is no ontological divide in the forms of life. Deep Ecology, therefore, aims for an environmentally sustainable and spiritually rich way of life that recognizes the intrinsic value of all life forms and the enchantment of the world. This course involves an introductory examination of Deep Ecology from a Religious Studies perspective that investigates traditions in terms of their thought, action, and communities.

The question then becomes how a society ought to manage and mitigate suffering in order to allow its citizens to live as happily as they possibly can. This course will look to the Hebrew Bible as a model text which grapples with this precise problem of creating justice in human society, examining how ancient Israelites set up their ancient societies and noting how their solutions to the problem of unjust suffering often continue to be influential in Western society today. We will look at how the Hebrew Bible constructs justice within three different spheres: law, religious ritual, and thought/belief. While law is the primary and intuitive medium for the formation of a just society, the other elements, as we shall see, are necessary as well, as law has a limited capacity to regulate human experience.

    :description: "This course is an in-depth examination of some of the major works of two key figures in modern Western thought, Immanuel Kant and G.W.F. Hegel. The aim is to become familiar with the particular conceptual worldview of each thinker, especially in terms of the following general \x93problems of modernity\x94: questions concerning the nature of selfhood and community, morality, the relationship between religion and reason (the religious and the secular), the meaning of the political and the natural, and the problem of modernity itself. The concept of religion will play a key role in our discussion in so far as both Kant and Hegel consider it to be a significant dimension of their metaphysical, moral, and political views. Our task will be to assess the nature of this concept for each thinker, how it fits into their projects as a whole, and what kinds of connections it has to other ways of thinking about religion, and to other ways of conceiving human values, e.g., rationally, politically, and aesthetically. The course will proceed through close readings and discussions of the texts. It will be advantageous to have some familiarity with modern philosophy and/or religious thought."

    :description: From the Great Awakening to the presidency of George W. Bush, evangelicalism has played a critical role in shaping American cultural and political institutions. Who are evangelicals? What do they believe, and how do they behave? Should non-evangelicals be worried about them? This graduate seminar explores the causes, nature and implications of evangelical influence. Discussions engage critical readings in the historical emergence and dramatic recent growth of evangelical and charismatic Christianity in the United States, with comparative attention to Canada and Latin America.

    :description: "While covering the history of the Czech and Slovak culture, the core of this course is the development of literature, music and visual arts. Also a brief survey of Czech and Slovak history is given. The course covers the development until the 1890s. Starting with the beginning of Slavic culture in the Czech and Slovak lands - the 9th century Great Moravian Empire made famous by the linguistic and literary work of St. Cyril and St. Methodius - the course deals with the Czech and Slovak products of Romanesque and Gothic culture, both in Old Church Slavic, Latin and in Czech. Special emphasis is placed on the flowering of Czech Literature, architecture and painting in the period of the Luxemburg dynasty, when Bohemia became the center of the Holy Roman Empire. The importance of John Hus (1379-1415), the founder of the Czech Reformation is further taken up, together with his successors, the Union of Czech Brethern, headed by J.A.Komensk (Comenius). The following period of the Czech cultural heritage is closely associated with Baroque culture which prevailed in the Czech lands from the end of the sixteenth to the end of the eighteenth centuries. It was rich in architecture, painting, etching, and folklore which was the main representative of the Czech and Slovak national consciousness in this period of extreme suppression of the Czechs by the Germans. The nineteenth century, which was marked by the influence of enlightenment, the French Revolution, German romanticism and the original concept of Slavism aroused by the writing of Herder, receives the greatest emphasis in this course. A number of outstanding representatives of this period are portrayed: J.Dobrovsk, the founder of Slavic studies; the poet K.H.Mcha who is closely related in his poetry with Lord Byron and Adam Mickiewicz; the historian F. Palack and others. While the elements of romanticism continued to linger almost until the end of the nineteenth century, the year 1848 represents a milestone in Czech culture and political history. It marks the first attempt of the Czechs and Slovaks to assert themselves in the political arena of Austria. Within a short period of time, Czech literature produced a number of outstanding realist and naturalist poets and novelists. Equally important and better known outside the country are the composers B. Smetana and A. Dvok, as well as the impressionist painters. The course is a combination of a survey and discussions on selected texts in its main corpus. Periodical sessions with pictures and slides illustrating the achievements in the visual arts, as well as music-appreciation sessions are scheduled. The relation ship of the Czech and Slovak cultures to the other European cultures is systematically explored. Requirements: Graduates - one paper around 15 pages. Undergraduates the same, or two papers around 7 pages each. Midterm and Final essay exam. Some semesters, periodic tests are given when class is predominantly undergraduate."

The novels provide artistic representations to the thoughts which preoccupied Tolstoy and Dostoevsky through their lives. The authors' shorter works will be projected upon the background of these masterpieces. Except for two beginning sessions, the course will combine lectures and discussions. All students are obliged to participate in daily discussions. Working for this course, each student is expected; 1.to present a 15 minute report and to develop this presentation in an analytical study of a chosen topic (6-8 pp). Drafts for oral presentations are to be consulted with the instructor a week before their presentations, and the written texts submitted to the instructor a week after the oral presentation. The topics should be chosen from the works other than War and Peace and The Brothers Karamazov. 2.to write a mid-term paper on either Tolstoy or Dostoevsky and to consider the major questions raised either in The Brothers Karamazov or in War and Peace 3.to produce a final paper focused on the most important themes of Tolstoy's and Dostoevsky's writings.

    :description: "The course attempts to cover, along with the history of Russian literature, many of the most urgent issues in the intellectual and socio-political life of the 19th century. The discussions will be focused on the three major novels by Tolstoy and Dostoevsky (War and Peace, The Brothers Karamazov, The Idiot.) and on the selections of their novellas. Course description and course requirements: Since most of the students are already familiar with Crime and Punishment and Anna Karenina, the emphasis will be given to The Brothers Karamazov,War and Piece and Dostoevsky's novel The Idiot. The novels provide artistic representations to the thoughts which preoccupied Tolstoy and Dostoevsky through their lives. The authors' shorter works will be projected upon the background of these masterpieces. Except for two beginning sessions, the course will combine lectures and discussions. All students are obliged to participate in daily discussions. Working for this course, each student is expected; 1.to present a 15 minute report and to develop this presentation in an analytical study of a chosen topic (6-8 pp). Drafts for oral presentations are to be consulted with the instructor a week before their presentations, and the written texts submitted to the instructor a week after the oral presentation.. The topics should be chosen from the works other than War and Peace and The Brothers Karamazov. 2.to write a mid-term paper on either Tolstoy or Dostoevsky and to consider the major questions raised either in The Brothers Karamazov or in War and Peace ; 3.to produce a final paper focused on the most important themes of Tolstoy's and Dostoevsky's writings. Mid-term and final papers are expected to be about 10-12 pp. each."

    :description: "The course covers Russian literature from the beginning of the 19th century (Karamzin) to approximately mid-sixties (Dostoevsky). An introductory lecture will consist in giving the historical and cultural background; the early 19th century will be introduced only by Karamzin's story \"Poor Liza.\" Each of the works rmentioned in the reading list will be submitted to close textual analysis, in addition to a general discussion of the author and his time. The authors to be covered show the evolution from Sentimentalism (Karamzin) to realism (the tendency that emphasizes the limitations that real life imposes on the individuals and shows the effects). Elements of literary criticism will be introduced in order to attain at a better understanding of the authors' intentions and artistic achievements. We will discuss the works' historical setting in order to see better how they represent the period's primary social forms, and how the authors portray the Russian polite society and the simple people. We will also treat the works' relation to human experience: how do the characters decide between their true \"I\" and the roles the society imposes on them? How do men and women reveal their feelings and affectations? How do social and philosophical problems find their way into the work of arts? Who is the hero/heroine of Russian literature of the 1800's-1850's? You will learn, how to discuss specific problems and how to express your critical opinions effectivelly. You will also learn, how to do bibliographical research and how to use auxiliary sources for your papers. You are encouraged to consult with me papers you will have to write."

This course investigates a basic problem of knowledge: To what extent do second language learners acquire knowledge of structures that are not licensed by their native grammar? Generally, we will focus on the gap between the information provided by the input and the state of knowledge that the learner develops (both cases where knowledge seems to far exceed the information provided by input and cases where acquisition seems plodding). We will investigate the following notions: the poverty of the stimulus problem, the underdetermination problem, the projection problem, and related paradoxes. We will consider a typology of poverty of the stimulus argumentation in L2 acquisition and the centrality of a learnability discussion in L2 work. We will examine types of explanations that various schools of thought have provided or suggested about the relationship between input and learner?s internal systems. Students will be developing their own research around a central learning problem under the guidance of the instructor."

How much are due to your agency in the world? In this course, we will examine the way in which people shape and are shaped their social surroundings. We will look at many aspects of social life, examining where and whether a line can be drawn between public and private domains in gender, religion, the family, the economy, educational institutions, business, politics and governance, health, international relations, the environment, food, death, inequality, entertainment, among others.

    :description: In this course you will learn to use the sociological imagination (systematically looking for "public issues" that underlie "private troubles, C.W. Mills) to discuss such topics as body image, the media, mental illness, education, and inequality. By attempting to discover the general in the particular through an examination of text, film, and the internet students are encouraged to look outside of their own experience to understand the world around them. Sociology is an exciting discipline and while most sociologists are traditionally employed within academia, careers range from business to law; for example, historical icons such as Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and former president Ronald Reagan were sociologists. Most importantly, sociology offers a range of explanatory perspectives and methodologies in the study of everyday life, from micro (relationships) to macro (institutional change) perspectives. This course will be an introduction into the diversity within this fascinating discipline.

    :description: "\"(Sociology) should rather cause us to see things in a different way from the ordinary man, for the purpose of any science is to make discoveries, and all such discoveries more or less upset accepted opinions.\" -Emile Durkheim Sociologists look at social life differently than people do in many other fields. How do sociologists approach the study of humans, and what do they find? For instance, are the rich really getting richer and the poor poorer? Why is some music played in symphony halls while other music is played in clubs? How has the structure of the family been changing, and what do people think about it? Why are some drugs illegal, some drugs legal with a prescription, and other drugs available over the counter? How does the study of broad trends and patterns like these help us understand individuals' lives and attitudes? Using lectures and discussion, this class will introduce students to the answers to questions like these. In the process, we will learn what sociologists do, why they do it, and what sociology can teach us about ourselves and the societies we are part of. Requirements for this class are 1) an open mind and perfect class attendance, 2) thorough study of readings before class, and 3) three in-class exams."

    :description: "How do sociologists look at the social worlds we all inhabit? In this course we\x92ll learn that sociologists have a unique point of view\x96the sociological perspective. Through this lens we\x92ll look at everyday rituals of deference and domination, solidarity and boundary-marking, conformity and resistance. The sociological perspective can help us to understand connections between self and society, private troubles and public issues, deviance and normality, order and conflict, and continuity and change. We can use the sociological mindfulness that this perspective gives us to explore how meanings are egotiated, races constructed, genders forged, sexuality policed, work defined, underclasses contained, deviants shamed and families shaped. We can also use the sociological perspective to become aware of how our culture, institutions, families and friends shaped our lives and to explore what our responsibility is to change society for the better. The overall aim of the course is to introduce a way of looking at the world--a sociological perspective or framework with which to ask meaningful questions about societies and their organization. Four specific features of the course derive from this broad goal. First, I assign only original scholarship by sociologists, rather than a textbook, as readings for the course. Reading original works by sociologists will give you the best sense of how a sociologist would approach a particular problem and work it through in terms of its origins, effects, and broader implications. Second, to challenge the tendency to view problems facing people in contemporary society as solely the result of individual flaws and virtues, I will encourage you to consider how social structural features of the society (e.g., the organization of the economy, political systems, the sexual division of labor) affect these problems. Third, although the main focus of the course is on U.S. society, materials on other societies and on processes of globalization will be introduced to show which features of our society are unique to the United States, which are common to all societies, and which vary from society to society. Fourth, through in-class exercises, surveys, and discussion, we will explore and become more aware of our own assumptions about society. The readings will consist of a reader and two paperback books: Walter LeFeber. 2002. Michael Jordan and the New Global Capitalism. Norton Press. Arlie Hochschild. 1997. Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work. Owl Books. Nancy J. Davis and Robert V. Robinson. 2006. Sociological Perspectives, 5th edition.

In this introductory course, you will learn to look at things from a sociological perspective \x96 which means that you will learn how an individual\x92s position within the social structure can affect his or her experiences and opportunities, which in turn affects society in general. This course will take a \x93social problems\x94 approach, which means we will be applying sociological concepts and theories to examine a number of problems and controversies that exist in our society. Some of the questions we will address in class will be: \x95 Why are so many people in this country unable to get themselves out of poverty? \x95 Why are African Americans more likely than whites to be arrested and imprisoned? \x95 Is the American family really in crisis? How is it changing, and what effects does it have? \x95 Why do so many Americans lack health insurance, and how does it affect our society? \x95 What explains the gender gap in earnings, and what effects does it have on individual people and our society?"

    :description: "Sociology is unique from other sciences because it offers social explanations of what people do and why. As opposed to psychologists or biologists, sociologists believe that peoples\x92 beliefs, actions, and life conditions come mainly from the interactions they share amongst each other rather than the inner workings of their minds or the contents of their DNA. Sociologists believe that the ways people communicate with each other, identify with each other, learn from each other, fight with each other and help each other are the foundation of human existence. Sociology is the study of those processes with the assumption that human interaction forms both individual traits and societal conditions. As such, sociologists look to human interaction when trying to understand social problems. The main purpose of this course is to introduce you to sociological explanations of some key problems which confront our society. In particular, we will analyze a variety of problems which relate to the reason you are enrolled in this course: the pursuit of education and people\x92s career opportunities. For example, why is it that more people are going to college than ever before, yet there is evidence that the middle class is shrinking? Why is it that there is a growing number of people who work 40-plus hours per week and still live in relative poverty? Why is it that girls are largely outperforming boys at all levels of schooling, yet women continue to earn roughly 76 cents on the dollar that men earn? We will wrestle with questions such as these, and draw upon sociological research to help us better understand social problems in education and work \x96 problems which all of us will be forced to confront in one way or another during the course of our lives. Another purpose of this course is to improve your overall skills as a student. My goal is to help all of you become better writers, better readers, and better speakers. Therefore, we will do a lot of all three through a series of discussions, exams, and a short paper on a social problem of your choosing."

    :description: "How do sociologists look at the social worlds we all inhabit? In this course we\x92ll learn that sociologists have a unique point of view\x96the sociological perspective. Through this lens we\x92ll look at everyday rituals of deference and domination, solidarity and boundary-marking, conformity and resistance. The sociological perspective can help us to understand connections between self and society, private troubles and public issues, deviance and normality, order and conflict, and continuity and change. We can use the sociological mindfulness that this perspective gives us to explore how meanings are egotiated, races constructed, genders forged, sexuality policed, work defined, underclasses contained, deviants shamed and families shaped. We can also use the sociological perspective to become aware of how our culture, institutions, families and friends shaped our lives and to explore what our responsibility is to change society for the better. The overall aim of the course is to introduce a way of looking at the world--a sociological perspective or framework with which to ask meaningful questions about societies and their organization. Four specific features of the course derive from this broad goal. First, I assign only original scholarship by sociologists, rather than a textbook, as readings for the course. Reading original works by sociologists will give you the best sense of how a sociologist would approach a particular problem and work it through in terms of its origins, effects, and broader implications. Second, to challenge the tendency to view problems facing people in contemporary society as solely the result of individual flaws and virtues, I will encourage you to consider how social structural features of the society (e.g., the organization of the economy, political systems, the sexual division of labor) affect these problems. Third, although the main focus of the course is on U.S. society, materials on other societies and on processes of globalization will be introduced to show which features of our society are unique to the United States, which are common to all societies, and which vary from society to society. Fourth, through in-class exercises, surveys, and discussion, we will explore and become more aware of our own assumptions about society. The readings will consist of a reader and two paperback books: Walter LeFeber. 2002. Michael Jordan and the New Global Capitalism. Norton Press. Arlie Hochschild. 1997. Time Bind: When Work Becomes Home and Home Becomes Work. Owl Books. Nancy J. Davis and Robert V. Robinson. 2006. Sociological Perspectives, 5th edition.

    :description: In this course, we will examine concepts of subcultures (groups of people with behaviors and/or beliefs that are different from a mainstream culture, but who are nevertheless a part of it) and countercultures (groups of people with behaviors and/or beliefs that are different from a mainstream culture, and who are actively trying to separate or isolate themselves and/or to change mainstream culture) across various sociological fields. We will start with examining linkages between culture and identities and their implications for collective identities in general, and subcultural and countercultural identities more specifically. Next, we will discuss the relations of subcultures and countercultures to delinquency, new social movements, ethnicity and race, religion and gender and sexuality. Finally, at the end of the course, we will examine youth and leisure subcultures.

I can assure you that you will observe a vast wasteland. \x97Newton Minow, 1961 This class focuses on issues associated with mass media. Topics include: media power, news cultures, media ethics, government regulation of the press, media and politics, advertising, media violence, and media as an agent of socialization. As this list suggests, the media serve as an important vehicle of power in the 21st century. Media owners control the platform from which messages will be delivered to millions of people world-wide. Who are these owners? And, do they socially construct reality for us? If not entirely, who are their partners in the social construction of reality\x97advertisers, politicians, artists? To what extent is your perception of the world created and manipulated by media? That is a difficult question to answer. And, you might conclude after taking this class that the media exert far less influence on audiences than critics argue. Nonetheless, news organizations do provide citizens with information that is designed to help them make decisions about their lives. Advertisers do attempt to influence what consumers buy and for whom the public vote. And, we must all think about the power of propaganda. This class is designed to increase your knowledge and understanding of the media\x92s impact on society. Not only will you learn more about the media\x92s role in American society, but you will also have the opportunity to join a public forum where you can express your opinion about it."

    :description: "Topic: Moral Controversy in American Politics In recent years, people have proclaimed that America is being torn apart by a culture war. Scholars and political commentators worry that the American ideal- E Pluribus Unum, Out of Many, One \x96 is becoming unattainable because our society is divided, like never before, over cultural and moral issues. According to this viewpoint, there is a battle for America\x92s soul being fought between traditionalists (who hold conservative, orthodox beliefs) and progressives (who hold more liberal, often secular beliefs). The field of battle includes issues such as gay marriage, abortion, evolution, euthanasia, sex education, and a variety of church-state issues. At stake in this battle, according to many, are radically different visions of what American society should be like. This course will discuss and evaluate this \x91culture wars\x92 thesis and then closely examine three topics that have generated moral conflict in recent years: abortion, homosexuality, and evolution. The course is intended neither to change your beliefs nor to determine what is \x91right\x92 and \x91wrong\x92, but to provide you with strategies for thinking about moral controversies in a more informed way. We will introduce a number of concepts that can help us think about these issues more clearly by understanding their political and social dimensions. We will learn about the role of religion in American public life, since morality and religion are closely intertwined in the U.S. We will place contemporary cultural debates in a broader historical context by examining similar debates during the past 100 years. We will look at changes in American culture since the 1960s that many people believe have caused the recent upsurge in moral conflict. We will outline some proposals for dealing with moral disagreements. And we will evaluate whether America is really as divided as some people claim."

How does it affect human behavior? In S101 you will lean how to identify the various components of the built environment and how to analyze them. For example, as we walk down an alley you might notice that the residential end has canopy, sub-canopy, and understory trees, while the commercial end has only canopy trees surrounded by pavement. You will use the knowledge you gain through this analysis to design landscapes which respond to specific social problems. For example, if commercial areas had the same mix of trees as residential ones do, they would be much more habitable places. You will also read about the history of cities, about the political and economic forces which create them, and about contemporary problems in cities. The course will consider cities all over the world, and through history. This is a studio-style course. You will spend your time visiting sites in Bloomington, drawing maps and graphs of those sites, analyzing yours and others= work, and presenting your work in class. For example, you might take photographs, make drawings, plot out a map, or construct a model to answer a question such as AWho is on the streets on Tuesday at midnight?@ Two of the three portfolio projects involve designing new environments for those sites which respond to specific social problems. Bloomington, Indiana is not the topic of this course. However, since it is nearby, and since its social problems are like those in many other cities, it will be the principal field site for the course."

Can environmental movements stem the tide of environment degradation? What is environmental racism and what can be done about it? What are the governments doing (or not doing) about global climate change, deforestation, and pollution? Why do we recycle? Is it possible to build communities and social systems that are ecologically \x93sustainable?\x94 What are the links between globalization and environmental protection? What is \x93nature\x94 anyhow? These are just a few of the questions that can be addressed by taking a sociological perspective on the natural environment. Often, the natural and social dimensions of human life are assumed to be disconnected opposites. In contrast, this course emphasizes the links between environmental conditions and the social formations and practices that underlay them. It will examine the organizational, political. and institutional conditions that produce environmental degradation, as well as the conditions that allow for positive environmental outcomes and ecological sustainability. We\x92ll tackle these issues at the local, national, and global levels and look for ways of moving between the local and global to connect problems and solutions. Throughout, the course will emphasize that positive environmental outcomes do not rest solely on individual attitudes about the environment, but depend critically on larger social institutions and power relations in a society. Therefore, the course will provide a tour not only of the natural world, but also of the organizational and political forces that shape contemporary societies."

In contrast to other disciplines concerned with mental disorders, sociology asserts that mental illness cannot be understood without reference to the social context in which it is experienced. In this regard, sociologists emphasize the socially-constructed nature of the categories that define mental disorders, the origins of mental disorders and mental health in social conditions, and the analysis of personal, community, and societal-level responses. This course will cover material in each of those three broad areas. Class sessions will emphasize team assignments based on deep reading of original sociological writings, analysis of personal memoirs, and discussion of cases.

    :description: "Above section COLL INTENSIVE WRITING Above section OPEN TO MAJORS ONLY The classical sociologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries asked big questions about the nature of society: What keeps societies together? What produces conflict? What shapes human action and decision-making? What are the social sources of power? How and why do societies change? They distinguished themselves from philosophers by working out their answers within the context of the major social transformations of their period: the industrialization of work, the expansion of capitalism, the growth of democracy and individualism, the rise of the bureaucratic organization, and the increasing influence of science. This course explores the continuing relevance of these classical theorists by examining how we can use their insights to understand aspects of our own era, such as consumerism, 21st century work life, social classification, modern ritual, the information revolution, genetic engineering, and divisions based on class and race. This course is also designated as an Intensive Writing requirement. Therefore an emphasis throughout the course will be placed on improving writing skills. All students should be co-registers in COAS W333. (You will receive a separate grade B Satisfactory or Fail B for this COAS part of the course.)"

    :description: "This course recognizes and examines childhood as a structural form and children as social agents who contribute to societal reproduction and change through their negotiations with adults and through their creative production of a series of peer cultures with other children. The course considers the relation of childhood to other social forms or institutions and examines children\x92s participation in and contributions to society historically and cross-culturally. The course will discuss research methods for studying childhood and compare the importance of family and peer experiences for children\x92s social development and the quality of their childhoods. There will be a special focus on the importance of peer interaction and culture for childhood. We will examine experiences in the family that play a key role in children\x92s transition to an initial peer culture. We will then describe and consider central themes and features of children\x92s preschool, preadolescent, and early adolescent peer cultures. The course also examines how cultural values and social policies in the areas of education, family, and work affect children\x92s lives. Finally, the course will examine the social problems of children and the future of childhood. There will be a mid-term exam, two (6-7 page) papers related to preadolescent and adolescent peer culture, a final paper (7-8 pages) related to the social problems of children, and weekly paragraphs discussing readings and class lectures. There will be a packet of assigned readings and three books for the course. The books required for the course are: Patricia A. Adler and Peter Adler (1998). Peer Power: Preadolescent Culture and Identity. New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press. William A. Corsaro (2005). The Sociology of Childhood. 2nd edition. Thousand Oaks, CA: Pine Forge Press.

After first examining the heyday of industrialization in different parts of the world, we will then consider the decline of industry. We will use Bloomington as an example of industrialization and deindustrialization. Following our study of the causes and consequences of deindustrialization, we will shift our focus to the parts of the world to which industry has moved in recent years. We will ask whether ordinary people in China, for example, have benefited from this global transfer of jobs. We will also consider the role of Wal-Mart in this process. Throughout the semester we will explore and debate the meaning of \x93good jobs\x94 and \x93bad jobs,\x94 and we will ask whether the global transfer of jobs has been good or bad for workers in different parts of the world.

It will cover the sources of its evolution: symbolic interactionism (and other interpretive approaches) in the United States, what developed out of the U.S. perspective in England, the influence of the French post-structuralists, the role played by feminist scholars and queer theorists, and the contributions of postmodernism and cultural studies. Students will see how these different origins have complemented each other in a contemporary approach to the study of human sexuality. In terms of substantive content, the course will examine how the constructions (e.g., interpretations, meanings) of various forms and facets of sexuality are related to the evaluator=s historical, cultural, and social location. We will look at the role of power, politics, and discourse in shaping constructions of sexualities and the misconceptions and socially-linked processes that underlie certain traditional interpretations. This analysis casts into relief the role of macro-sociological factors as well as those on the interpersonal level (such as the Aslight of hand@ used in transforming notions about \x93statistical normality\x94 into imputations about \x93psychiatric abnormality\x94Ce.g., most people are heterosexual, so bisexual and gay/lesbian people are psychologically abnormal). A Asex radical pluralist@ model of interpretation (one that has been delineated by social constructionists) is proposed as an alternative to the conservative traditional one. The specific \x93sexualities\x94 to be discussed include nudism, forms of sex work, intergenerational sex, homosexuality, bisexuality, sexual contact with animals, transgender variations and sexuality, fetishism, sadomasochism, fisting, urine play, and the playing with and eating of feces.

    :description: This is a one credit graded course open to interested sociology majors (freshmen, sophomores, or juniors) or potential majors. The goal of the course is to provide students with information that will help them plan the remainder of their undergraduate education and, ultimately, help them prepare for a career. Students will learn about the various occupations in which their sociology major and liberal arts degree can be applied, focusing on the types of skills and knowledge required for these occupations, and the relevant coursework, research/internship opportunities, and graduate training necessary to enter these occupations. Students will also engage in self-assessment to develop a better understanding of their own skills, interests, and strengths. This course will accomplish these goals through a variety of activities (panels and presentations.) There will also be an individual reflection component to the class. Students will complete the StrengthsQuest program, which assists them in identifying core strengths and interests. They will engage in one-on-one discussion of their interests and abilities with the instructor of the course, and with a career counselor at the Career Development Center. Purchase of a new StrengthsQuest text (from the bookstore or TIS) is mandatory. Attendance is mandatory. There will be several brief homework assignments. There is no final exam.

    :description: "This graduate-level course surveys a range of theoretical approaches and areas of research within the subfield of social psychology. The primary focus will be on sociological approaches, although we will examine a few psychological approaches (e.g., cognition, attribution processes). The readings emphasize theoretical issues as well as the application of theory to a variety of substantive areas. This component of the class is quite important since students are expected to leave the course with a strong sense of the historical development of social psychology as well as its use in current sociological (and non-sociological) bodies of literature. Social psychology is, by its very nature, an interdisciplinary field; therefore students will be introduced to a variety of topics introduced to us in a range of scientific journals. This class will demonstrate the utility of collecting a tool chest of social psychological knowledge that will help any student better explicate the social relationships or phenomenon to which s/he is trying to better understand (ex: race relations, gender, inequality, marital relationships, organizational dynamics, health, poverty, law, and society). Students will also gain sense of the methodological challenges facing social psychologists. All course objectives will be pursued through lectures, readings related to lecture topics, discussion in class of lectures and readings, and films/videos."

This class will be a valiant (possibly foolhardy) attempt to make social theory not only interesting but useful for students entering careers of teaching and doing research in sociology. How? Our vision throughout the semester will be presentist: that is, we shall focus our attention on the theoretical choices facing sociologists today. Now, perhaps more so than any moment in the history of our discipline, it is essential to keep asking the question: how shall I do sociology? The question is difficult not because answers are scarce, but because there are so many answers to choose from. Frankly, I celebrate the diversity of sociologies on the menu these days; tired formulas are not why I chose this profession. Have no fear: the \x93greats\x94 will be covered. But our presentist focus will have us read the Holy Trinity (M,D, and W) not as intellectual history but as resources for doing sociology in the new millennium. The classics offer a legacy of concepts, explanations, interpretations and methodologies, from which we must pick and choose the parts useful for the agenda each of us has set. But soon we\x92ll quit the antiquities and move on \x96 over half the semester will be spent on social theory since WWII. Once upon a time, our predecessors chose among Marxism, functionalism and symbolic interactionism; today, we face the bewildering array of post-modernism, critical theory, rational choice, feminism, neo-institutionalism and constructivism. There is no mainstream any more in social theory, just many babbling brooks. What are the contentious theoretical issues that face us now? Here are some old questions \x96 old and new \x96 that sociologists will continue to answer in different ways: what is scientific sociology, or is that an oxymoron? how are politics related to intellectual inquiry? if you choose micro units of analysis, how do you then deal with the macro (and vice versa)? how are structure and agency linked? is culture something we should leave to anthropologists? is the demarcation \x93social organization/social psychology\x94 (ossified in the curriculum of this Department) a dusty impediment to good sociology? is reductionism inevitable? who, besides sociologists, does sociology? is it desirable to explain? whatever shall we do with the non-human, or the non-social? is nomothetic knowledge dangerous? At the end of the semester, each of us should be able to answer these questions (and others) in an informed, principled way, drawing on our readings of how other smart social theorists answered them. Of course, it is impossible to do this in fifteen weeks, but\x85 The reading load is heavy (no escape from that). Those students enrolled for credit will write two take-home exams, and participate in one e-mediated conversation (graded). A course syllabus is available from Tom Gieryn upon request."

    :description: "Topic: Social Psychology of Self This course explores the concept of self and related concepts (e.g., identity, social identity, self-esteem) as used in social psychological theory and research. While the major contributors to the topics of the course have been and are both psychologists and sociologists, the course will focus mainly on the work of sociologists, paying some but lesser attention to the work of psychologists. The course begins with an overview and history of the use of self and related concepts in social psychology. It then deals with various contemporary perspectives on self, moving on to alternative theoretical usages and empirical research, focusing in particular on self-esteem theory and research, what is termed \x93Identity Theory\x94 and related research, and theories of self and identity deriving from cognitive social psychology. The last of the class sessions of the course will consider a number of current issues in work on self and identity. While there are lectures, the classroom segment of the course will basically proceed as a seminar: students will prepare one or two brief papers to be presented in class, and time will be set aside for discussion of what I may say in lectures, the readings that are assigned, and the class presentations. However, precisely how we will proceed \x96 the \x93formality\x94 of the lectures; the mix among lectures, discussion and presentation of papers, etc. \x96 will not be determined until the size, composition, and background of the class becomes clearer than they are at this writing. Social psychology is by definition an interdisciplinary field to which the work of (particularly) sociologists and psychologists but also representatives of other disciplines is relevant. This course seeks to introduce graduate students to theories and research on an important concern of social psychology, one that is integral to both sociological and psychological social psychology, namely the concern with the determinants and the interpersonal consequences of self and the closely related concept of identity. It does so primarily although not exclusively as this complex concern is viewed by persons whose disciplinary background and identification is in sociology. It is organized, first, to acquaint the student with the range of theoretical frameworks or perspectives that have been and are used to theorize about self and identity and to conduct research based on this theorization. It is organized, second, to illustrate the relevance of sociology per se for social psychology more generally, as well as the relevance of social psychology for sociology per se. Third, it is organized to have to do with the social psychology of self and identity and to encourage students to visualize interesting research possibilities that can be developed from one or another of these theoretical issues. Lastly, but not incidentally, the course is organized so ideally, the student will develop a good sense of the social psychological domain of self and identity, a critical but constructive sense of the theoretical and methodological issues in that domain, and a strong sense of the relevance of this domain of social psychology for his/her interests in sociology or related fields."

    :description: "Topic: Social Networks Perhaps the single thing that sociologists agree on is the central importance of social interaction as the building block of social life. From Georg Simmel on, terms like social networks, social integration and social capital have been used to conceptualize and operationalize this fundamental component in sociological research. These various terms, combined with other conceptual issues and difficulties in empirically translating the whole notion of \x93networks\x94 in actual research, presents a continuing dilemma for sociologists. We will take a historical journey through the development of network theory and analysis. This course traces the development of network thinking from Simmel\x92s \x93social circles\x94 to Durkheim\x92s inductive conceptualization through \x93sociometry\x94, some small group research of the 1950s and 60s, the advent of \x93blockmodeling\x94 in the 70s, and ending with recent work since that time. In sum, the goals of this course are to provide students with 1) a solid introduction to network thinking in its various guises, 2) an understanding of key themes in the history of network analysis and the relationship to theory development, 3) an appreciation for some of the important connections between network analysis, theory and more general issues in social research and 4) to provide some hands-on experience with the methods, analytic techniques, opportunities and limitations in bringing this approach to empirical research."

We will question the way in which power dynamics influence these social statuses by focusing on their interlinkages. The course will be divided into two sections. The first half will examine the experiences of people who have been oppressed, with a special focus on those who have experienced multiple forms of oppression. We will cover a variety of theories including social constructivist, post-modern, feminist and Afrocentric thought. The remaining part of this section will focus primarily on issues of identity, peer culture, body, and sexuality/relationships. In the second half of the course we will examine how groups of people learn to be dominant, turning to issues of whiteness, masculinity, and class domination. We will begin by looking at a variety of contextual factors that influence conceptions of race and of whiteness. Then we will look at different forms of masculinities. We will also examine upper middle class views to see how they are shaped and linked to those of other privileged statuses. This section will conclude with an examination of key processes of domination and resistance as well as a general discussion of perspectives on social change. Course Goals: One of my goals for this course is to have active participation by all class members. This means that all students are expected to participate in class discussions. In addition I hope that class members will provide feedback about course goals, progress in meeting them and classroom dynamics throughout the semester. Also, you will have the option of helping prepare for the class by either distributing readings for one week of the course or co-leading a discussion for one week. Finally, I hope that during class discussions we will respect and value differences in perspectives, opinions and backgrounds. Course Requirements: All students are expected to do one major paper-- either an empirical study, a research proposal, or a library research paper. Group projects are an option and should result in a more expanded paper. In addition, you can choose to do two or more of the following options: 1) take a midterm take-home exam, 2) write reflection papers on the readings for three of the weeks, 3) give an oral presentation of your paper (either on the week most relevant or the last week of class), 4) do a community service learning project combining volunteer work with reflective writing and give an oral report. You will be able to divide the way your grade is computed among the three or more requirements as long as the paper receives at least 40 per cent of your grade and you stick to round numbers (ex. 40-20-20-20)."

    :description: "Topic: Development and Globalization This course is an introduction to the methodologies, major theoretical approaches, and ongoing debates in the sociological study of global political economy. The goal of the course is to equip students with the necessary knowledge to either (1) devise a research project that addresses one of the key issues in the field of development and globalization, or (2) enrich their micro- or meso-level research in any other fields of sociology by situating the particular social processes under scrutiny in the macro-level context of global political economy. The course is divided into two parts, the first part covers established theories and research traditions in the sociology of development, with a special attention to how they address the trend of contemporary globalization. The second part deals with the cutting-edge research on novel phenomena that emerge under globalization.

The effectors or subsystems of the human vocal tract pro duce forces, movements, sound pressure, air flows and air pressure during speech. These subsystems include the chest wall, larynx, velopharynx, and orofacial [lip, tongue, and jaw]. The selection, sequencing and timing of these articulatory subsystems to produce intelligible speech is orchestrated by the nervous system. The speech motor control system also benefits from several types of sensory signals, including auditory, visual, deep muscle afferents, and cutaneous inputs. The multimodal nature of senso ry processing is vital to the infant learning to speak, and assists the mature speaker in maintaining speech intelligibility.

    :description: "Purpose: The purpose of this course is to introduce you to clinics, clients and clinicians, and the clinical and supervisory processes. You will learn the clinical practicum sequence and the important dynamics of both processes in speech-language pathology and audiology. Basic information regarding certification, professional standards and ethics, goal setting in both the clinical and supervisory processes, lesson planning, methods of observing, describing and recording behavior, informal assessment and other related topics will be presented. Quizzes: Between the first day of class and the beginning of the clinical labs in late October, there will be 5 unannounced quizzes. Each quiz will be worth 10-20 points. Together they will total 100 points and will contribute 15% to your final course grade. Examination: There will be one major examination. It will come at the end of the more traditional lecture material and before the clinical labs begin. As much as is possible, the exam will ask you to apply the information from the class lectures to the solution of professional and clinical problems. The fact that there is only one examination which contributes a major percentage to the final grade has initially troubled students in the past; however, this way of assessing your knowledge and more importantly your ability to use it, is consistent with evaluation schedules and formats in many graduate programs. Using it in this course will help prepare you to successfully make the transistion to your graduate training. Professional Responsibility: This course is the first in the professional curriculum of the department and your training. As such, it requires that you begin to develop a sense of professional responsibility toward your education and clinical training. Aspects of behavior which demonstrate this responsibility include meeting deadlines, regular attendance, legible and complete written work, and most importantly, the development of a professional demeanor. To underscore the importance of these aspects of your professional development, a percentage of your grade will be determined by your attention to them. Attendance will be taken during every class meeting. You may have two unexcused absences; after this, absences will negatively impact your grade. Clinical Labs: This course will also provide you the opportunity to apply much of the content about the clinical process to specific disorder areas. Each disorder area will be addressed through the presentation of structured, videotaped observational experiences by the instructor (and other members of the faculty). These experiences will provide you the change to not only observe a wide range of clients and disorders, but to think, plan, and write about the management of the client/disorder as you apply the information about the clinical process from the first half of the course. In addition to beginning the process of learning about clients and communication disorders, the observations will also provide opportunities for you to begin to think about your own behavior as clinicians. Each in-class observation/clinical lab experience will involve a written task which will furnish you a structured opportunity to design a treatment plan for a hypothetical case in each disorder area presented. Opportunities may also be designed to help you structure clinical development plans for the acquisition and refinement of your own clinical skill(s). These labs will require that you be prepared to take the time necessary to complete them in a professional manner. They will be turned in and graded by the instructor and will contribute to your final course grade. Observation: Each student is expected to observe a minimum of 25 hours of treatment and assessment to meet the ASHA requirement for observation and before you may be assigned a client in practicum. You will continue the process of observation in S461 that you began in earlier courses. You will need to keep a log of each observation that you complete; the hours that you have already observed in S420, S436, etc. will be carried forward and added to the hours you will observe over the course of this semester until you have accumulated the requisite 25 hours. A form will be provided to you for the purpose of keeping this log. At the end of the semester, TOTAL YOUR OBSERVATION HOURS ACROSS ALL COURSES, and turn the log in. I will then sign it and it will become part of your permanent ASHA record in the department. BEFORE YOU TURN IN YOUR LOG, MAKE A COPY OF IT FOR YOUR OWN RECORDS. YOU WILL NEED TO DOCUMENT THESE HOURS OF OBSERVATION FOR THE GRADUATE PROGRAM IN WHICH YOU ENROLL BEFORE YOU MAY BE ASSIGNED A CLIENT IN PRACTICUM. You will be required to write summaries of three (3) observations. These written summaries should apply the information about form and content of professional writing developed within the content of the course. Forms to facilitate your completion of these summaries are found in the packet of materials for this course (which is available at Collegiate Copies). The summaries will read and graded by the instructor and will contribute your final grade.

    :description: "Course Objective: To gain a basic understanding of the structural organization (anatomy), function (physiology), and neural control of the human vocal tract during speech production (speech motor control). The effectors or subsystems of the human vocal tract pro duce forces, movements, sound pressure, air flows and air pressure during speech. These subsystems include the chest wall, larynx, velopharynx, and orofacial [lip, tongue, and jaw]. The selection, sequencing and timing of these articulatory subsystems to produce intelligible speech is orchestrated by the nervous system. The speech motor control system also benefits from several types of sensory signals, including auditory, visual, deep muscle afferents, and cutaneous inputs. The multimodal nature of senso ry processing is vital to the infant learning to speak, and assists the mature speaker in maintaining speech intelligibility. Pathophysiology of vocal tract subsystems due to musculoskeletal abnormalities, brain injury, and progressive disease will be presented during the course of the semester."

    :description: Developmental apraxia of speech is a diagnosis that is used clinically, usually to describe children with multiple and severe difficulties with speech sound acquisition. The precise criteria for this diagnostic label have been the source of debate in the research and clinical literature. Most treatment protocols have not withstood controlled investigations of their efficacy. The goal of this seminar is to define developmental apraxia of speech, determine how it can be differentiated from other speech acquisition problems, and become familiar with treatment protocols that appear to be efficacious. These goals will be met by investigating models of speech production and its development, becoming familiar with the experimental literature that has focused on differential diagnosis of developmental apraxia, and evaluating different regimens that have been recommended for treatment of this disorder.

    :description: "Brief course outline: The purpose of this course is to introduce students to the wonders and complexities of child bilingual/second language acquisition (SLA) so as to prepare them to work effectively with the increasing child second language learning population. Because effective clinical work requires background knowledge on bilingualism and language development, the first part of the course will discuss research in the area of bilingual and second language acquisition in children. It will also include a discussion of phenomena that are particularly salient in bilingual populations and that directly impact assessment and treatment of bilingual children. Issues concerning the interpretation of child second language acquisition research will also be discussed. The second part of the course will present strategies for assessment and intervention with bilingual children from infancy to school age. Through active discussion of the assigned readings and the use of clinical case studies, students will learn to apply what they have learned to the field of communication sciences and disorders. It is important to remind students that although the topic of assessment and intervention will be discussed in detail during the last five weeks of class, applications of the research to assessment and remediation will be discussed throughout the class. Students will be expected to demonstrate skills in applying research into practice. Class participation. Students will be expected to come to class prepared. By this it is meant that students should have done the readings that were assigned for that particular class. (The assigned readings for each class are presented in the course outline.) The format of this class will include not only lecture. Group discussion of the assigned readings and the clinical cases that will be presented to the class and that pertain to the topic under discussion will be incorporated into the class. Although I am aware that students vary in terms of degree of participation, I expect all students to demonstrate that they have read the assigned materials and that they are applying the knowledge gained to the case studies. Failure to evidence this will negatively impact your class participation grade. Class attendance (i.e., coming to class regularly, on time, and not leaving before the class officially ends) will also be included under class participation. Tardiness means that if you are not in class by the time I begin lecturing, you are late. I will begin class promptly at 9:05 A.M. Absences and tardiness will also negatively impact your final class participation grade. Readings: As mentioned above, I expect students to come to class having read the assigned articles / book chapters. In order to have students begin to apply research and theory to practice, I have incorporated an activity where students are to indicate how the readings can be applied to practice. Before each class meets, students will be required to e-mail me a brief summary of how the readings that will be discussed in class can be applied to our clinical practice. I should receive these e-mails by 8:00 A.M. of the day the class meets (i.e., Tuesday by 8:00 AM). In this e-mail, students are to indicate the following: (1) for each reading \xAD how the data, theories proposed or summary of research can be useful for our work with children who are bilingual or who are learning a second language; (2) any questions that the student has about the readings. Your completion of this task will be part of the class participation grade. Through this task, you can begin to look at the value of research from different areas for our own clinical development. It will also aid me in addressing questions or concerns you may have. I a sense, then, it will aid me in focusing class activities to address your concerns. Special project: Students have the option of doing one of the following as a special project: (1) research proposal, (2) analysis of a bilingual or SLA child's abilities in a particular area (e.g., phonology, syntax, pragmatics), including socio-emotional and attitudinal aspects, (3) traditional research paper, or (4) a workshop for a particular group in the area of child second language acquisition. The specific instructions for each of the possible projects will be discussed in class. An initial reference list and proposal (what you plan to do) will be due on October 10. (This will be part of the final grade for the project.) The due date for this project is November 14. Class assignments: Weekly assignments will be given in class that relate directly to the topics covered in class and in the readings. These will be due on the following class period. Each assignment will be worth 15 points (10 points for how well the issue(s) is/are addressed, and 5 for ability to incorporate information from the readings). The final grade for the assignments will be the average score the student obtained on these. (Please note: These are weekly assignments. The due dates of the projects are written in the course outline and assignments will be given regardless if something is due or not. Thus, you need to start working on the projects early.) Presentation: The last two weeks of class will consist of student presentations. These presentations will entail presenting an assessment or treatment protocol for a child who is either bilingual or SLA. This will be done in pairs. Specific instructions for will be given in class. Observation report: Each student will conduct an observation of a child who is SLA within a preschool context. A written report will follow the observation. The main purpose of the observation is for the student to evaluate the child's L2 learning and communication strategies as he/she is immersed in an English-speaking preschool. Observation sites within the University will be provided. NOTE: For all projects, assignments, etc., I will hand out detailed information regarding instructions for completing the project and how I will grade it. I also have a web page that you can access. In it you will find copies of the syllabus and of the instructions for the special project, assignments, and final presentation.

    :description: "&#65279;Course Objective: Motor speech disorders is a broad category that includes any speech disorder that has a neurological basis. As such, there are an infinite number of causes for these disorders and an infinite number of profiles that can result. Therefore, this course will serve only as an introduction to motor speech problems and their underlying disorders. There are three main goals that I hope we can meet. First, it is important that you have an understanding of the neurological conditions that cause motor speech disorders. You will be surprised by how much your clients know about their disorders and, therefore, you need to have a conversational knowledge of the neurology associated with their speech function. The second goal is to provide you with the tools that you will need to assess motor speech disorders. We will approach this issue by looking at established tests, their strengths and weaknesses, and how they can be used to plan intervention. The third goal of this course is to provide you with the means to make treatment decisions. Our approach to reaching this goal will be to look at many of the things that can go wrong in speech production, how to decide on the basis for the speech problem and how to approach improving communication. &#65279; Grading: Course grades will be based on grades from two, short- answer quizzes, a midterm exam, presentation and handouts on disorders, class participation, and a final exam. Exams and quizzes: Both exams will be taken out of class and you will have one week in which to complete each exam. Any reference material may be used during the exams, including discussions among yourselves and with the instructor. The examinations must be written independently, even though you may have obtained information from many sources. Please refer to the university\x92s policy about plagiarism. The quizzes will be given in class. Presentation and handouts: The presentation/handouts/paper will focus on describing a disorder to a lay person (e.g., what is Parkinson\x92s disease?). These presentations will give you an opportunity to distill complex information to a form that is accessible to people without medical, technical, SLP backgrounds - i.e. families of clients or administrators. Additionally, you should consider printed information that would be useful to the lay person. This can take the form of handouts, brochures or a short review of your presentation (in written, not powerpoint, form). These handouts/papers can be shared among the class. If you give me the originals at least one week before your presentation, I will have the handouts copied by the university. If I do not have them by this deadline, you are responsible for copying the handouts. Grading of these presentations and handouts/papers will be on a 30 point scale with 15 points for the presentation and 15 points for the written material. Points will be given for content (6 points), 5 points for appropriate level for the intended lay audience, 2 points for style and 2 points for organization. Your course grade will be calculated, as follows: Class participation 5%; Two quizzes 15%; Midterm Examination 25%; Final Examination 25%; Class presentation and short paper 30% Grading Scale: 96% and above = A+; 93 - 95% = A; 90 - 92% = A-; 87 - 89% = B+; 83 - 86 = B; 80 - 82% = B-; 77 - 79% = C+; 73 - 76% = C; 70 - 72 = C-..."

    :description: "intervention in most health-related fields requires the practitioner to develop treatments that are specific to the individual. Although it may be impossible to know the best treatment protocol on an a priori basis, treatment decisions must be 1) based on ethical principles; 2) made responsibly in line with the existing evidence in the literature; and 3) presented in a professional manner. The objectives of this course are to introduce you to the evaluation of literature that will help you make responsible decisions about assessments and treatments, introduce you to ethical dilemmas and possible paths towards their resolution, provide you with the tools to determine the importance and/or validity of procedures that you might use, and to foster writing skills that will be needed in classes and clinics in this department. Finally, this course will provide an outline of steps needed when writing a graduate thesis, should you decide to undertake such a project. In line with these objectives, you will have an opportunity to develop facility with literature and library searches, as well as abilities to assess the importance of research findings. Book: Shiavetti, N. and Metz, D.E. (1997). Evaluating research in communicative disorders. Boston: Allyn and Bacon. Other materials: Articles on the reference list can be obtained at the IU Library. Course requirements Assignments: There are four short written assignments and one longer written paper/presentation. The longer papers will be done in groups and all group members will receive the same grade. Grading: Your grade will be based on: Attendance, class participation, reading of material - 5%; Four short papers - 40% and discussion leader - 10%; One research paper/presentation - 45%. Grading Scale: 96% and above = A+; 93-95% = A; 90-92% = A-; 87-89% = B+; 83-86% = B; 80-82% = B-; 77-79% = C+; 73-76% = C; 70-72 = C- Readings: Readings should be completed before the class devoted to that topic. Short assignments: These papers will focus on evaluation of different sections of a research article, as well as procedures for literature searches. Each short paper should be 2-3 pages long. The papers should include answers to the questions presented in class handouts. The class will be divided into groups of students who will be responsible for specific papers. Students in each group will read the specified paper and present a brief overview of the paper\x92s strengths and weaknesses to the class. One student from each group will be assigned to lead the discussion of their article; group leaders will rotate through the semester. You are welcome to discuss the articles with other group members, however, the paper that you hand in must be done independently (i.e., you are to write the paper by yourself) Each short paper has a value of 10 points; therefore, the short papers will contribute to 40% of your course grade. There will be a maximum of 10 points given for your role as discussion leader. The literature search will be the basis for your longer paper so the quality of this work will be assessed by the quality of your longer paper. All papers should be written in accordance with APA style. Longer paper: This paper will be no more than ten pages in length. The focus of the paper is on a controversial issue in speech-language pathology. The topics for these papers will be decided during the third week of class and guidelines for writing the paper will be handed out at that time. The purpose of this paper is to provide a concrete problem to which you can apply the principles that are discussed in class. Sample issues will include different treatment protocols, assessment procedures and tests of theoretical models. This paper/presentation will contribute to 45% of your course grade; 30% will come from the paper and 15% from the presentation. All papers should be written in accordance with APA style. The remaining 5% of your grade will come from class attendance and participation."

    :description: Gay, lesbian, and bisexual people are an important segment of American society as reflected in the increasing visibility of GLB people in positions of power, in entertainment and the media, and the plethora of political action on GLB issues. Yet this population faces inequality in legal protections and prejudicial societal attitudes. GLB people routinely deal with homophobia and heterosexism at political, legal, and interpersonal levels. Therefore, a familiarity with issues unique to the GLB population is vitally important for all individuals who want to provide informed and helpful services to people in need. This course explores the developmental issues that impact gay, lesbian, and bisexual people, using a social work person-in- environment perspective. It is grounded on a current understanding of theory and research, and will include topics such as GLB identity formation, homophobia, heterosexism, history of the GLB civil rights movement, racial and cultural diversity within the GLB community, and life span issues. This course incorporates current events as they relate to and illustrate course content. Class exploration and discussion of issues are emphasized. The course is appropriate for students in social work, education, nursing, med sciences, psychology, health and recreation, or for any other interested students.

The class will touch on traditional marketing concepts (terms such as branding, reach, frequency, consumer research), and emerging new technologies, tactics and techniques. Since marketing is an evolving discipline, emphasis will be placed on current strategies and techniques employed throughout all media, with a concentration on television. Marketing is also a collaborative process, so class participation and a cooperative project will be part of your grade. Course Objectives: * To understand the purpose of marketing in electronic media; * To conceive, execute and evaluate marketing strategies and tactics; * To acquire knowledge of disciplines within marketing departments; * To increase awareness of marketing efforts of the media. Course Philosophy: \x93Marketing means solving customers\x92 problems profitably.\x94 -- Randall Chapman, PhD (www.marketingprofs.com) * Marketing is cumulative. Your grade will be too. Rather than taking points off for mistakes, you will accumulate points for everything you do \x96 attendance, class exercises, assignments and exams. * Marketing is a dialogue. This class will be too. * Marketing is not about one-size-fits-all solutions. We will look at how you know when to break with convention. * Marketing is about prioritizing and deciding what is the best solution for you. You will be forced to deal with the reality of small budgets, limited time and compromising the quality of your work. * Marketing is about responding to what is happening in the marketplace. We will be observing what is currently happening in electronic media and analyzing the thinking behind those choices."

T504 Introduction to Telecommunications Policy Studies Fall 2007 Prof. Barbara Cherry T504 is the starting point for the graduate-level study of telecommunications law, policy, economics and technology in the Department of Telecommunications. It prepares students for more advanced law and policy courses at the 500 and 600 level, such as Tel-T530. T504 provides a selective overview of the law and public policies in the United States affecting communications technologies. It reviews the development of the major bodies of law \x83{ constitutional law, statutory law, common law, and administrative law \x83{ to regulate telecommunications and mass media industries. An awareness of important historical developments in telecommunications policies provides the necessary foundation for interpreting and analyzing current issues and controversies arising from the evolution of telecommunications technology towards more integrated networks and globalization. This course presumes an undergraduate-level knowledge of the U.S. legal and political system, U.S. electronic media law and policy, electronic media technologies, and the structure of electronic media industries. Students who did not study electronic media law and policy and the electronic media industries in their undergraduate or masters' programs will probably have to do additional readings, very early in the semester, in order to be adequately prepared."

Main topic areas are the production, pricing, and distribution of information products; and the economics of information networks and standard setting. A central theme of the course: When is government intervention desirable, and what policies are most likely to work? Examples of questions we address: How can economic incentives to create intellectual property be preserved in the presence of cheap copying devices and file sharing? How can owners of intellectual property use copying and electronic distribution to their advantage? What are the economics of electronic vs. hardcopy textbook and academic journal publication? What are economic arguments for and against fee-based library services? Why does the U.S. dominate the world export of entertainment and other information? How can critical mass be achieved in information networking? Are compatibility standards affecting media or telecommunications networks best set by government or by private industry? Policy analysis in the information industries must be interdisciplinary, but economic analysis gives one useful perspective. First, economics provides a specific framework for evaluating social welfare. Second, economic analysis can make good predictions about whether different policy options are likely to work or not. Also in the class, we get insights into which business strategies are most likely to work for information industry firms and organizations. The class does not have a prerequisite. Some basic microeconomic principles will be provided as the course proceeds.

The course is pitched at a social level of analysis and will encourage seminar participants to think expansively about the impacts new technologies have on different aspects of society, including social structure and social behavior, civic participation, politics and power, economic trends, policy developments, and the increasing mediation of everyday experience. Throughout the seminar we will consider how the forms technology takes have been shaped by society, and how the structure and organization of society, in turn, has been influenced by technology. Topics will include the nature and development of information societies and networked media systems, the experience of new media through interactivity, virtual community, ubiquitous surveillance, and technological acceleration, and the latent potential of technology to not only render space and time obsolete but also ease aggression and facilitate destructive tendencies. The seminar will work from a foundation of communication theory important to thesis or dissertation work and will maintain a cross- disciplinary appeal. Although this semester's emphasis is on the "network society," the course should benefit graduate students interested in media and new technology generally, regardless of their specific field of study.

It is designed to introduce you to a variety of different aspects of European political culture, political parties, interest groups, political institutions. European integregation, and new social movements. The goals of this course are threefold. First, you should learn in some detail about three countries which we will focus on: France, Germany, and Great Britain. Secondly, you should learn to evaluate some important theories about politics. And last, you should learn to think rigorously and comparatively about politics. Comparative thinking is an extremely useful analytical tool and we will frequently employ this method in the course to demonstrate its utility. The required readings are drawn from four books which cover the three countries. The reading load averages about 100 pages a week. Course requirements include a midterm exam, a final exam, and a term paper. Exams typically consist of a combination of several identifications and a longer essay question."

Individuals who practice the religion or who belong to ethnic groups that are traditionally Muslim are now estimated to make some 2% of the North American population and 4% of the European Union\x92s population, and their numbers are expected to continue to grow. The attacks of September 11, 2001 and the wars that followed highlighted and amplified the role and perception of Muslim minorities in the West as political actors and electoral constituencies, subjects of cultural hostility, scapegoats for poor economic performance, suspects in the face of insecurity whose rights could be exceptionally curtailed, and agents for the projection of geopolitical power. Western states and their rapidly growing Muslim populations are adjusting to each other under the constant pressure of exogenous shocks. The way they manage the process will deeply affect Western polities and their relations with the Muslim world. Substantive topics we will explore include: How/why do different states strike a balance between security and civil rights/liberties? Is there really a tradeoff between the two? How do they deal with immigration, both permitted and unregulated? What factors affect the degree of political participation by Western Muslims? Why are culture clashes more salient in some countries than in others? Why do Muslim immigrants prosper more economically in North America than in Europe? How do international conflicts affect the relationship between Western states and their Muslim citizens and the dynamics among citizens of different backgrounds? Is there a connection between Islamophobia and anti-Semitism in the West? Are we witnessing the birth of a Western Muslim macro-ethnicity or many disjointed ethnic communities? How are Muslims perceived in their Western societies and how do they perceive their fellow citizens? What will the future hold? Students are expected to regularly participate in discussions and to write two 5-page papers and a 10-15 page research paper."

Two world wars, the rise of fascism and Stalinism, and large-scale genocide mark the dark sides of Europe\x92s twentieth century. Yet, the twentieth century also witnessed major advancements in European democracy. It brought the downfall of property and gender-based suffrage restrictions and the emergence of welfare states aimed at alleviating the social inequalities and hardships of the capitalist market. In the decades after 1945, stable parliamentary governments increasingly prevailed in Western Europe, and by the end of the 1980s, largely peaceful revolutions had swept away Eastern Europe\x92s repressive state- socialist regimes. This class will focus on the complexities and contradictions of European history between 1900 and 2000; we will also ask to what extent the weaknesses of European democracy have been overcome successfully in recent decades. What have Europeans learned from the disasters of the twentieth century, and what are the prospects for a transnational European identity? The readings draw on a broad range of analytical approaches and include national case studies as well as comparative works.
