      Due to creating BUSA 691 and BUSA 692 - and in interest of
      consistency - we wish to have it showing as: BUSA 690 Topics
      in Management 1 (need to have "Management 1" so can have
      "Management 2 & 3").  To be used as a backup topics course,
      on a as needed basis, for a term when require more than one
      topic course number.  This occurs when more than one topic
      course is offered in a particular term but the student is
      prevented from registering in duplicate course numbers (even
      with different sections).  Also, the University receives
      payment based on course numbers, irrespective of the number
      of course sections.  As an example: for Summer 2005:
      MRKT-690 Topics: Retail Management; MRKT-690 Topics: Summer
      Abroad course (Brazil); and MRKT-690 Independent course with
      the supervision of a faculty member.  Students often wish to

The analysis of the structures of the Spanish language will be used to outline common problems of translation and to help students develop strategies for solving them. Students who are proficient in either English or French will be asked to do comparative studies of Spanish and their target language. Active participation in workgroups (oral and written) is essential since students will apply in practice what they have seen in theory. Objectives: To perfect students' knowledge of such concepts as language level, barbarisms, false cognates, and principles of correct usage; to provide an in-depth study of translation procedures and mechanisms, emphasizing the stylistic differences in language pairs; to examine and compare the underlying structures of Spanish and the target language used by the student. /\n\

      This is the first in a two-course sequence in microeconomics. The core microeconomics sequence (ECON 610, ECON 611) provides a rigorous coverage of the economic foundation upon which economic fields are built. Most of the sequence is devoted to building up this foundation of consumer and firm optimisation (including choice under uncertainty), partial and general equilibrium, and welfare economics. The remainder of 154-611 covers special topics that vary from year to year. These are likely to be drawn from the following: social choice; externalities and public goods; models of asymmetric information; the principal-agent framework; search; basic game theory.

      The course concentrates on what may be the most scarce resource for most corporations today - the customer. The course examines how organizations research what the customer wants and needs. The course also looks at the social and psychological backgrounds of consumer choice and looks at the methods for grouping consumers into segments according to the heterogeneity of their desires. The firm's response to consumers is then considered. First, the need satisfying item is considered - the product. Following this, the elements of the marketing mix, distribution, pricing and promotion, are considered.

      While technology per se exists in many domains of the firm, this course focuses on the research and development domain of the firm. This is an essential function - even in low-tech industries, well managed RD&E is essential because this is what provides the attributes and performance capabilities that customers desire in the products and services sold by the firm. Thus, every manager must understand how RD&E applies knowledge to achieve new performance capabilities, producing new products or services or enhancing existing ones. In addition, managers must be aware of the special and challenging issues faced by managers of this domain. Finally, managers must be aware of how they can provide a more effective link with the RD&E function.

      The main objectives for this five-week rotation are to develop the history taking and physical examination skills necessary to collect information and make the diagnosis of the patient. The student also learns the pathophysiology of surgical conditions. These objectives help prepare the student for clerkship in the senior years where the issues of patient workup and management are covered. The ICM-C Surgery rotation involves being assigned to a surgical service and tutor, seeing patients in the preoperative and peroperative period and following the patient postoperatively. The student will workup two patients per week on the ward and in the ambulatory care setting and follow each patient through the entire peroperative period. Apart from doing histories and physical examinations, the student will learn how to write progress notes and prepare for case presentations. The objectives of knowledge are primarily covered in small group teaching sessions held in the hospitals. These cover a broad range of topics in the fields of surgical principles and all the subspecialties of surgery. Students are encouraged to attend services rounds, ward rounds, and participate in the operative management of their patients. Students do their rotations at the MGH, RVH, JGH and SMH.
