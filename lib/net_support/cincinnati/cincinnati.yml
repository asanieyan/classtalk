    :description: The thesis is a major project of research and/or creative work that extends professional knowledge and awareness surrounding the design and production of cities, buildings, and interior environments. Designed as a three-quarter sequence, students explore historical, theoretical, and technical issues related to a specific area of inquiry, leading to the development and production of a program of research or design, including the presentation of preliminary documents, contextual analyses and findings on which students will base future work. Students document these findings in conformance with criteria established by the graduate faculty, then develop and produce projects in accordance with previously identified topics and themes. Finally, students refine and complete these projects, in conformance with criteria for presentation established by the graduate faculty. Thesis Studio 23ARCH901 is the multi-quarter course name and number; grading is assigned as SP or UP, satisfactory progress or unsatisfactory progress, until the final quarter of completion.

    :number: "173"
    :description: This freshman seminar/field trip is structured to take students through "space and time" from 300 AD to comtemporary times. The primary theme is changes in the landscape or the "sequence occupance" of the region. Students will meet once a week in preparation for the winter break field trip to the Yucatan. The trip will explore Mayan archaeological sites from Uxmal (300 AD), Ek Balam, to Chichen Itza (1100 AD). The Colonial era will be highlighted with tours through Merida (1545), Ixamal, a salt plant operational since the 1700s, and a hacienda. Contemporary changes of the region are viewed with visits to an ejido, a henequen plant, a US manufacturing plant and experiences with the pros and cons of tourism - a government planned resort on the Caribbean (Cancun). The physical-environmental geography of the region will be introduced with an opportunity to swim in a Karst cave, visit a large flamingo sanctuary, and hike through a community-initiated nature preserve in Quintana Roo. Students also have free time for self-exploration, an important component of the educational experience.
